    <h1>Rum and Cachaça – What</h1>
    <p>
        Rum is any distilled spirit created from sugarcane. The vast majority of rums are produced from molasses, the
        by-product of refining sugarcane into raw sugar. The minority, principally Brazilian cachaça and French rhum
        agricole, are produced from the juice of sugarcane after it’s pressed. Molasses can be used to make light, soft rums
        (as Cuba and Puerto Rico are known for) or dark, pungent rums ( Jamaica’s reputation was made by this style), as
        well as everything in between.
    </p>

    <p>
        The variables that can differentiate one style from another include such obvious matters as the time in oak and the
        type of oak (or other woods, in the case of Brazilian cachaça), whether pot stills or continuous stills are
        employed, whether flavors or spices are added, and perhaps less obviously, whether molasses, cane syrup or the
        freshly extracted juice of the cane is used to create a fermentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Techniques and styles vary not only from country to country, but often within countries. Jamaica is known for dark
        and heavy rums. But in fact, the most popular rum in Jamaica is a white rum with a high proof, 126 degrees, called
        Wray & Nephew.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the rundown that follows, you’ll note that the decision to use molasses, cane juice or syrup might be the most
        important factor in the style of the rum.
    </p>


    <h1>Rum and Cachaça – Where</h1>
    <p>
        Rum is made anywhere sugarcane is grown and in many other countries besides. You don’t need to grow cane to make
        rum. Two hundred and fifty years ago, rum was widely produced in both England and New England, all from molasses
        imported from the Caribbean. Even today, much of the molasses that Caribbean and other countries utilize for rum
        production is supplied by Brazil.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most consumers believe that rum is solely a product of the Caribbean, and indeed most of the famous names in rum are
        island based. But quality rums are produced on every continent (well, okay, not Antarctica) and in a myriad of
        styles. Moreover, the sugarcane plant doesn’t originate in the Caribbean, as most believe, but hails from somewhere
        in the Far East, perhaps Indonesia. A distilled spirit from sugarcane may have been the basis for what is the
        earliest known large- scale distilling; it took place in what is now modern-day Pakistan over 2,500 years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cachaça is made from sugarcane juice and comes only from Brazil, the world’s largest sugarcane producer. It is
        bottled from between 38 percent to 51 percent alcohol and is produced by as many as 30,000 small distillers. An
        incredible 98 percent of all cachaça is consumed in Brazil. Cachaça comes in a trio of classifications: unaged (1
        year in wood), aged (2 to 12 years in wood), and yellow (immature spirits that have caramel or wood extracts added
        so they can appear older).
    </p>


    <h1>Rum and Cachaça – When</h1>
    <p>
        The rum we know today probably has its origins in desperation. Early Spanish and Portuguese settlers in Central and
        South America, as well as the Caribbean, had no wine and needed alcohol. We don’t exactly know how and when, but
        they were creating a rudimentary distillate from molasses within a few decades of their arrival in the New World.
        Once again, there is no “aha!” moment to declare New World rum’s time of birth. But the pangs are evident in the
        names chosen to depict the fiery spirit: “kill-devil,”,“demon rum,” “rumbullion” and “rumbustion,” the latter two
        terms used to connote mayhem.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The popular image of pirate juice is closer to the truth than any other popular image. Rums were distilled from
        molasses that might have been left to spoil for weeks, and then fermented. Straight from the still, these rums were
        either consumed on the spot or went into barrels and on to ships. The barrels were probably empty before a few weeks
        had passed.
    </p>

    <p>
        From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, lots of rum was being distilled in New England and particularly in
        or near Boston and coastal Connecticut. Ships laden with sugarcane, only recently arrived from the Caribbean or
        America’s Southeast, wouldn’t transport sugarcane back to England. Instead they would drop their loads in New
        England and take back a far more concentrated form of sugarcane: raw sugar.
    </p>

    <p>
        With all the leftover molasses, the early American colonials made their own kind of rum, but it too must have tasted
        like the same hot liquid that the pirates were drinking. Meanwhile, back in the mother country, connoisseurs of
        Punch were developing a taste for rum and initiating the process that led to the taming of this fiery spirit. To
        soften rum’s heat, you either need a careful fermentation (that wasn’t happening centuries ago), a selective
        distillation (nobody’s throwing out perfectly good pirate juice), filtration (that’s a late nineteenth century
        innovation) or long barrel aging.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally, no one was willing to wait for rum to age in barrel long enough for the spirit to soften. That would
        change: as one English epicure noted in 1737, “in order to make Rum palatable to any Person of nice Taste, it must
        be carefully kept in a good Cellar for several years.”
    </p>

    <p>
        That aged rum was becoming increasingly available. In Barbados in the seventeenth century, so much rum was being
        produced that plenty of it was available for sale elsewhere. Some of those barrels took enough time to transport
        that the rum they contained took on the elements of well-aged rum: honey, caramel and vanilla, as well as a gentler
        nature. Barbados rum was famous enough that George Washington insisted on a barrel for his inauguration, and it was
        highly prized on the London docks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other islands saw similar growth in reputation. Jamaican distillers started their fermentations with molasses from a
        previous fermentation, to more rapidly initiate the fermentation in a batch of fresh molasses. Those rums were far
        funkier in aroma, and the Jamaicans, too, learned to age them in barrel as long as possible to soften the weirdness.
        In some cases they added spices and flavorings, and most islands did the same for at least some of their rums.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Demerara river region of British Guyana was noted for its Jamaican-style rums as well. It didn’t hurt that the
        Royal Navy was issuing its sailors a daily dram of old rum, blended from Jamaican and Demerara sources, a practice
        that didn’t end until 1970.
    </p>

    <p>
        The French Islands used only cane juice since Napoleon owned sugar beet factories in France capable of producing raw
        sugar. With no home market for refined sugar, the French Islands were free to use the juice itself. As a result the
        rum produced on the French Islands (Martinique, Guadalupe, Marie Galante) as well as on former French possessions
        such as Haiti is something different from other rums. Cane juice rums can be more herbal and vegetal, but also more
        tropical in fruit character. Today, not all rhums (that’s how the French spell it) are made from cane juice, but the
        best are. They’re referred to as rhum agricole, or “agricultural rum” (as opposed to rhum industriel, or “industrial
        rum,” which is made from molasses).
    </p>

    <p>
        By the late nineteenth century, Cuba had emerged as a sugar producing dynamo (as usual, made possible either by
        slave labor or slavery like conditions) and all that leftover molasses had to be used. Don Facundo de Bacardì began
        filtering his rums through charcoal, as vodka producers were famously doing, and thereby created a gentler rum.
        Later, he and his competitors employed continuous stills to make something closer to vodka.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the Cuban Revolution, the Bacardi family escaped to Puerto Rico. Today, the rules of Puerto Rican rum
        production demand that no rum can be distilled below 160-proof. For some, that means the rums are more boring and
        have less of the character of traditional rum. To many, lighter, gentler rum is exactly what they want. As with all
        things about flavor, preference is personal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, in Cuba, rum production continued with the flagship export brand (to everywhere but the U.S.) assuming
        the old pre-Revolutionary brand of Havana Club and retaining the richer, more fullflavored character of
        pre-Revolutionary Cuban rums.
    </p>

    <p>
        But rum’s resurgence may be tied to its distinctive flavors rather than to its ability to seem like vodka. The
        cocktails that have epitomized rum drinks: Rum and Coke, Piña Colada, Daiquiri and such might be ideal for the
        neutral-style of rum. But the two drinks that have brought rum back to the cool side of the pool are the Caipirinha
        and the Mojito. Both demand that bartenders re-learn the old-fashioned practice of muddling.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Certainly, one of the largest selling and most important segments of rum is the flavored rum category. Rums such as
        Malibu (created in Barbados in 1980), Cruzan and Captain Morgan have revolutionized and revitalized the industry.
        Most popular flavors include coconut, mango, passion fruit, spiced, vanilla, citrus and others.
    </p>

    <p>
        And a Caipirinha requires cachaça, a Brazilian rum made only from cane juice and often aged in unusual indigenous
        woods like freijo, cedar, imburana, cherry and jequitiba. Those barrels smell as unusual as they sound, but the
        exotic, tropical, herbal aromas of cachaça add funk and excitement to the smell of a great Caipirinha.

    <h1>Tasting Rum and Cachaça</h1>
    <p>
        As usual, the best way to find flavor and identify differences is to put several rums next to each other. But the
        amazing variety of rums means that three aren’t enough. Instead, place one rum from each of the dominant styles next
        to each other: spiced, flavored, Jamaican, Puerto Rican, cachaça, Barbados, and Martinique (to name only a few).
        Smell, taste and compare them. Now add in some of the others that are out there—and see if they seem similar to one
        of the dominant styles. Try several brands all in the same style—differences can be strong here too.
    </p>


    <h3>You’ll taste them to see if they are:</h3>
    • Clean or dirty
<br>
    • Dry or slightly sweet
<br>
    • Smooth or aggressive
<br>
    • Gentle or powerful
<br>
    • Oily, grainy or soapy
<br>
    • Rich or thin
<br>
    • Soft, sharp or burning
</ol>
    <p>
        Rum should be clean and dry and not bitter and not sweet, unless it is a sweetened and flavored type.
