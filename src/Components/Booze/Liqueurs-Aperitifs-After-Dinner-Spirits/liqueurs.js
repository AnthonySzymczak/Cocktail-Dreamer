    </div>


    <h1>Liqueurs - What</h1>
    <p>
        Liqueurs/cordials are defined as alcoholic beverages of a spirits base and made of grain, grape, fruit, or vegetable
        that are flavored with:
    </p>

<ol>
    • Botanicals such as herbs, barks, seeds, roots, plants
    • Fresh and dried fruits
    • Dairy products, including butter, cream and milk
    • Honey
    • Spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, pepper, coriander
    • Beans including cocoa, coffee, vanilla
</ol>

    <h1>Liqueurs - How</h1>

    <h3>There are four methods for flavoring a spirit, none of which have changed in last four or five hundred years.</h3>

<h4>
    •  Compounding – a supplement made of a sugar solution combined with concentrated flavorings is added to the base
    alcohol.

    •  Infusion – a liquid is steeped with the flavorings (fruits and/or herbs) prior to distillation. The resultant drink
    will probably be fairly light in flavoring aromas.
    •  Percolation – flavorings enclosed in a screen or net are placed inside the still to flavor the distillate as it
    passes through. This process can capture very intense or very ethereal aromas and flavors.
    •  Maceration – a distilled spirit steeps with the flavorings for a period of time, often weeks. This may not capture
    more delicate aromas but will certainly contain the strong and often bitter flavors of a fruit or herb.

</h4>

    <h1>Liqueurs - Where</h1>
    <p>
        Liqueurs are made in any nation that produces beverage alcohol. They have existed for at least six centuries.
        History’s first liqueurs were made in Europe to combat intestinal problems like dyspepsia, or difficult digestion.
        Particular liqueurs made of special combinations of roots, barks, grasses, plants, seeds (caraway, aniseed) and
        herbs (mint, sage, rosemary) have been long known to aid digestion, which is why liqueurs are typically served in
        postprandial situations. Other common ingredients in liqueurs, such as honey and cream, likewise assist in
        processing foodstuffs through the intestines and colon.
    </p>

                           
    <h1>Fruit and Nut-Based Liqueurs</h1>

    <ol>
    Note: in the United States, a fruit “brandy” is generally in fact a fruit liqueur consisting of heavily sweetened
    and flavored grape brandy.

        • Amaretto (Italy) - originally from Italy, this almond-flavored liqueur gains its flavor from apricot stones, though
        some utilize almonds as well.

        • Peach Schnapps - common and popular version of schnapps.
        • Rock and Rye - Rye whiskey with rock candy and fruit flavors added.
        • Sloe Gin - sloe berries from Blackthorn bushes, otherwise known as sloe plums, provide the flavor for this
        once-popular spirit. Plymouth Sloe Gin is a quintessential example.
        • Southern Comfort - a proprietary cane spirit blended with peach liqueur.
        • Triple Sec - a clear, higher-proof version of curaçao; see Cointreau.

</ol>

    <h2>Bitter Liqueurs (Aperitifs and Digestifs)</h2>
    <p>
        In general, these come in two kinds: aperitivi (in France, apéritifs) “openers,” which are lower-proof and meant to
        be taken before a meal to stimulate the gastric juices, and digestivi/digestifs, “digestives,” which are higher in
        proof and follow a meal to help everything digest properly. The bitterness usually comes from the use of quinine,
        which serves an additional anti-malarial function. As the category names imply, they are a particular specialty of
        Italy and France, although Central Europe makes a fair number as well.
    </p>


    <h2>Amaro/Amari:</h2>
    <p>
        Amaro, Amer and Amargo are respectively the Italian, French and Spanish words for “bitter.” This
        traditional category reaches back to the beginnings of distillation and therefore to the creation of healthful, even
        magical medicines through alcohol’s ability to extract and preserve the vital essences of plants. Most of these
        bitters still boast of their histories as folk medicines. Italy, in particular, is rich in these amari. Indeed, it
        seems like every town on the Italian peninsula makes its own type. Amari may be either aperitivi or digestivi.
        Typically, they are produced by macerating herbs, roots, flowers, bark, and/or citrus peels directly in the alcohol.
        This mixture is then allowed to age in casks or bottles.
    </p>
        
<ol>
    • Amer Picon (France): herb-based aperitif with bitter orange notes.
    • Becherovka (Czech Republic): bitter herbal golden-amber-colored liqueur with notes of clove, cinnamon, and ginger;
        produced according to a secret recipe since 1807 and currently enjoying a resurgence among craft bartenders.
    • Campari (Italy): red, bittersweet Italian aperitivo without which a Negroni cannot be made.
    • Fernet Branca (Italy): a digestivo with a cult following among American bartenders
    • Jägermeister (Germany): an herb-based digestif.
    • Lillet (France): a lightly-quinined aperitif with notes of orange; comes in a delicate white and a more robust red.
    • Malnais Balzams (Latvia): herb based bitters.

</ol>

    <h2>Vermouths and Aromatized Wines:</h2>
    <p>
    Vermouths are a special category of aperitifs. The word vermouth comes from the
    German “Wermut”, for wormwood. In most cases, aromatic wines are fortified with grain or grape spirit. The
    Italian-style vermouths were traditionally sweet and red (the color comes from the botanicals, not the wine, which
    is white) but in 1800 Joseph Noilly of France, introduced a new, dryer style of vermouth that was white. Although
    Italian and French vermouth differ slightly, the basic formula consists of a base wine that is mixed with mistelle
    (sweetened grape juice and brandy) and flavored with herbs, roots, bark, and flowers. The manufacturing process is
    fairly complex. Herbs and flavors are steeped in the base wine and in the brandy. After steeping, the wine, mistelle
    and brandy are blended mechanically in large vats. The mixture is then pasteurized and then refrigerated for two
    weeks to allow impurities to crystallize, then filtered and bottled.
</p>

    <h2>Anise Liqueurs and Absinthe</h2>
<p>
    Absinthe, the anise-flavored spirit, was first made in Switzerland in the mid-eighteenth century. Among the first
    commercially produced anise-flavored spirits, absinthe was made with oil extracted from wormwood leaves. Wormwood
    belongs to the same plant family as tarragon and mugwort, and contains a powerful substance called thujone, about
    which a great deal of misinformation has been printed.
</p>
<p>
    The German word for wormwood is wermut, and early vermouths contained the thujone-producing wormwood. After several
    well publicized drunken murders, absinthe was made illegal in most countries, and vermouth producers quietly
    discontinued the use of wormwood. Absinthe was one of the most popular distilled spirits in the late nineteenth
    century, both drunk on its own or dashed into cocktails. At the beginning of the twentieth century, however,
    concerns about its high alcohol content and “toxic” thujone (not in fact present in any quantity in most well-made
    absinthes) led it to be banned in the United States and most European countries.
</p>
<p>
    In the first decade of the twenty-first century, global prohibitions against absinthe began to collapse. Since it
    was legal in some parts of the E.U., it was difficult to prohibit in others. The U.S. ban on absinthe was lifted in
    October of 2007. This loosening of restrictions has meant that brands are now flooding into the market, including
    one of the originals, Pernod Absinthe.
</p>

    <h2>Sherry (Jerez/Xeres)</h2>
<p>
    From its earliest days, Sherry (or Jerez) has had a significant role in the world of cocktails. Coming from the
    beautiful region of Andalucia in the southern tip of Spain, Jerez is a fortified wine produced from three types of
    vinifera grapes. Palomino, the most important variety, is a white grape that is fermented to be bone dry and is
    utilized as the base for virtually all types of Sherry. The Pedro Ximenez and Moscatel grapes are both harvested
    late and arrested during fermentation to lock in their rich sweetness. These two varieties are added to dry Sherry
    to make it sweet.
</p>
<p>
    The wines are fortified with low alcohol grape brandy before being blended in the Solera method of aging. This
    process creates several differing styles of Sherry, ranging from light, crisp and very dry to dark rich and as sweet
    as wine can be. Sherry, no matter dry or sweet, retains high levels of acidity due to the climate and the Albariza
    (high-calcium) soil that exists in the vineyards of Jerez.
</p>

    <h3>Sherry’s styles include:</h3>
<ol>
    -Fino and Manzanilla: Fortified to develop a thick layer of flor, a naturally occurring layer of yeast that protects
    the wine from oxidation during aging. These wines are very light in body and high in crisp acidity.

    -Amontillado: Allowed to undergo some oxidation, this style of Sherry is light and nutty with dried fruit and nut
    flavors. It is fuller-bodied and darker in color than Fino, yet is still dry on the palate.

    -Oloroso: Spending most of its time aging without the protection of flor, Oloroso develops a flavorful, fruit-driven
    style. Oloroso has several incarnations, some of which have no sweetness at all. The rich nature of the wines,
    however, makes them delicious when blended with wines from the Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel Soleras. Check the labeling
    to determine whether it is a dry or a sweet Oloroso.

    -Palo Cortado: This rare variety is defined as having the qualities of both Amontillado and Oloroso. Palo Cortado is
    a unique style that has similarities to both. Always special, these wines are identified by their unique development
    within an individual Solera.

    -Dessert Styles: Whether Oloroso blended with a percentage of Pedro Ximenez and/or Moscatel, or those same grapes
    bottled on their own, you will find a range of dessert styles of Sherry from slightly sweet to deeply sugary with
    unctuous flavors of figs and dates.
</ol>
<p>
    Sherry has always been successful in cocktails. The Sherry Cobbler was one of the first and most popular. Today,
    Sherry has been reinserted into the world of mixology with varying styles being stirred in to accompany or replace
    vermouths and bitters, and shaken in to utilize the numerous flavor profile. Bartenders have rediscovered that the
    acidity, body and varying tastes that exist within the category make Sherry a versatile addition and enhance their
    ability to create exciting drinks for their guests.
