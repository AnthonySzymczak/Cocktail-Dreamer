<h2>Gin - What</h2>
<p>
Gin is a spirit that is typically triple distilled, based upon neutral grain spirits, and cut with distilled water. In
most cases, the grain spirits have been created through a double or triple column still distillation. Then the grain
spirit is distilled a final time in a pot still with botanicals including juniper, oil of juniper, coriander, orange
peel, lemon peel, anise, cassia, bitter almonds, caraway, cocoa, angelica root, orris root and many other ingredients.
For proprietary reasons, producers zealously guard their botanical recipes.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, it is possible to learn a great deal about any gin and its recipe from the flavors and aromas. Juniper is
    distinctly peppery and herbal. If it smells like a Christmas tree, it’s because juniper berries grow on evergreen
    bushes. Some of the most highly prized juniper berries are grown and aged for several years in Tuscany.
</p>

<p>
    Citrus peel adds lemon, orange and lime elements; that seems obvious. Coriander, the seed of the cilantro plant, adds an
    herbal aroma, but also brings a tart, even grapefruit-like flavor to the gin. Cassia brings a somewhat bitter note,
    something like tonic water. Other ingredients may offer floral notes, vegetal notes, even tea flavors; flowers,
    vegetables and tea might also be a part of the recipe.
</p>


<h1>Gin - Where</h1>
<p>
    Gin can be made anywhere that distillation occurs. Still, there are four approximate types of gins, and those gin types
    tend to come from certain places.
</p>

<p>
    For more than a century, gin producers around the world have looked to London Dry Gin as the benchmark gin style. While
    it can be made anywhere—it needn’t come from London—the style is nonetheless still strongly associated with Great
    Britain. Juniper and/or citrus tend to dominate the botanical profile. Alcohol range is from 37.5 to 55 percent by
    volume; the traditional strength is 47 percent.
</p>
    
<p>
    Genever or Hollands gin is produced in the Netherlands, Belgium and small parts of France and Germany. It has some
    yellowish color, may be distinctly sweet, in opposition to London Dry, and can be powerful and oily. Made mostly from
    the pot-stilled barley/rye distillate known as “malt wine,” usually with neutral grain spirits blended in, it’s always
    more malty/grainy/cereally than herbal or fruity/spicy. Alcohol range is from 35 to 50 percent by volume.
</p>

<p>
    Plymouth, England is home to a single gin distillery, Blackfriars, and a distinctive style called Plymouth. Plymouth Gin
    is lower in alcohol than London Dry varieties but owns an earthy richness that is unique. Alcohol is 41.2 percent.
</p>

<p>
    So-called “New” or “International Style” gins are as diverse as the many places from which they derive. Alcohol range is
    from 40 to 55 percent by volume. Typically, other botanicals than juniper tend to dominate.
</p>


<h1>Gin - When</h1>
<p>
    If gin is a juniper flavored grain-based spirit (and it is), then there would be nothing wrong with proclaiming Arnaud
    de Villanova as gin’s inventor. He is credited with developing the European practice of distillation in the thirteenth
    century A.D., perhaps acquiring the skills developed centuries earlier by Muslim scholars, Geber and Avicenna.
    Importantly, his first products were grain spirits distilled with juniper berries. Why? Juniper has long been known to
    possess healthful properties (that’s why we drink gin now, right?). Masks made of juniper were believed by some to offer
    protection from the plague. Juniper is likewise believed to aid when ailments of the kidneys strike.
</p>
    
<p>
    But Villanova’s gin was more or less a one-off. In the end, it was the Dutch who invented the spirit we know as gin. The
    word is theirs, as well. They call juniper genever in Dutch; the British turned that word into “geneva” and then
    abbreviated it to “gin.” For the Dutch, alcohol’s preservative abilities were ideally suited to retain the character of
    the spices and fruits they were trading.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout much of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, the Dutch were masters of the high seas and, as
    such, pioneered and dominated international trade and commerce. All the major European powers, namely, the British,
    Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch, vied to create the fastest and most direct route to the spice regions of eastern Asia.
    The stories of their competitions and subsequent ruthless methods once they arrived in places like the Moluccas (where
    cloves grow) have filled bookshelves. The Dutch East India Company was particularly successful.
</p>

<p>
    While Dutch ships entered the port of Rotterdam, much of their cargo was loaded to an upriver suburb called Schiedam.
    Consequently, Schiedam’s warehouses were bulging with fruits, spices and other raw goods and materials. By the
    seventeenth century, four hundred pot stills were in use to convert those goods into something with a bit more
    longevity. Juniper was a prime ingredient for their genever, but many other ingredients found their way into the
    increasingly complex brew. Genever was reportedly healthful and, man, it was potent. The British called the drink Dutch
    Courage because they frequently hired Dutch mercenaries to do some of their military dirty work. The Dutch mercenaries
    were known to drink copious amounts of genever and were notoriously effective in their ferocity.
</p>
    
<p>
    But the British and many of Continental Europe’s monarchs did not get along in the late 1600s. So, the English Crown
    decreed that any British subject could distill this so-called Dutch Courage, in the hope that the increasingly thirsty
    British people would stop buying French brandy and that perhaps Holland’s genever might be supplanted as well. As
    history depicts, the plan worked.
</p>

<p>
    By the early 1700s, Dutch Courage had become “Mother’s Ruin.” The ravages and dislocations of the Industrial Revolution
    were at least partially blamed on gin, which had swept through England’s burgeoning cities like liquid crack. Gin was
    accused of being evil. With distilleries working in seemingly half the back rooms of London churning out inexpensive,
    semi-poisonous spirit from the cheapest materials available, that description wasn’t far-fetched.
</p>

<p>
    After the “Gin Craze” burnt itself out in England, gin became celebrated as something essentially British. England shut
    down home distilling through Parliamentary laws and built beautiful gin palaces to lure the populace into a more
    controlled—and taxable—setting. Gin Punch became one of the sporting drinks of the upper class at home while for the
    protectors of the Empire in the far-flung tropical regions of India and Africa gin and quinine-water became the tonic
    drink (as in, medicinal) of choice.
</p>

<p>
    By the early 1800s, English gin’s style had distinguished itself from the malty, rich Dutch style. Where the Dutch
    worked to make the best, most flavorful (pot-still) base spirit they could and then flavored it simply with juniper and
    small amounts of other spices, the English relied on a base spirit that was rectified—that is, redistilled and filtered
    to remove as many traces of the base material as possible—which was then flavored with a complex mix of botanicals and
    then, usually, sweetened. This style was known as Old Tom gin.
</p>

<p>
    In the 1830s, Charles Tanqueray created the distinct style of London Dry Gin, altogether crisper and lighter than the
    genevers and even the hitherto-dominant Old Tom gins. With the introduction of continuous stills, the distilleries in
    the Lowlands of Scotland were fired up. Ironically, much of the grain whisky they made (and still make) wasn’t intended
    for Scotch whisky but instead for the gin distilleries of England. With the help of the neutral spirit they provided,
    London Dry Gin had become by the end of the nineteenth century the preeminent, defining style, produced by dozens of
    distilleries, each with its own proprietary blend of botanicals.
</p>

<p>
    This explosion wasn’t occurring just in Britain. In the U.S., distillers began making the new London Dry style, which
    was much cheaper to produce than the malt-rich Dutch style. In Ireland, Cork’s Watercourse Distillery had a tradition of
    gin-making dating back to 1798, with its own special botanical formula, but didn’t launch its Cork Dry Gin, or “C.D.C.
    Gin” (so called after its maker, the Cork Distilleries Company), until 1941, when the distillery installed a column
    still that enabled it to make a true dry gin.
</p>
<p>
    After a century of widespread popularity, gin has struggled since the explosion of vodka in the 1970s. In the last
    decade though, gin, perhaps sensing imminent doom, has begun to revisit its roots. Now, after three decades of decline,
    there are suddenly dozens of new brands. Some of the gins in the market are rootier, more idiosyncratic, and Plymouth
    Gin, an icon among English gins that almost disappeared, is reborn. Genever is coming back to the world stage after a
    century of eclipse (naval embargos during the first World War and German occupation during the second effectively
    destroyed its foreign markets). While finding a bottle sometimes requires an exhaustive search, there is good news from
    Bols, which has recently reintroduced their classic genever to the global market. There are even contemporary versions
    of Old Tom Gin available again, if with limited distribution. Bottom line is: gin is back!
</p>
    

<h1>The Gin Rules</h1>
<p>
    With the recent explosion of Gin as a category, there seems to be a certain amount of misinformation about the
    regulations regarding it, so let’s set the record straight. First, since gin is originally a European product, these are
    the EU rules, and as such, American gins do not necessarily need to follow these rules. That said, most American
    distillers seem to have embraced these regulations as their own, perhaps out of respect for their forebears or perhaps
    because they hope to sell some spirit in the European Community.
</p>

<p>
    Today, we classify Gin by both geographic origin and style. It should be pointed out that although London Gins began as
    products of that city, today, the name London Gin, or London Dry Gin, is a style that can be made anywhere, as long as
    the producer adheres to some very strict rules. This is contrary to the regulations for Plymouth Gin, which must be made
    in the town of Plymouth, England, and Genever/Genievre/Jenever, which must be made in The Netherlands or Belgium, and as
    such are considered PDOs, or Geographic Indications of Origin, and have their own sets of rules and regulations.
</p>

<p>
    There are currently nine other PDOs for Gin in the EU: two of which are German, one each from Spain and Lithuania, and
    the remaining five from Slovakia.
</p>

<p>
    There are also classifications for the use of the word Gin, which are, in ascending order of specificity, from just
    calling it Gin, to Distilled Gin, to London Distilled Gin (insert the word Dry as preferred), which is a type of
    Distilled Gin, that must be distilled to a minimum of 70 percent, then redistilled in a traditional (pot) still with
    botanicals that are all natural plant materials, of which the juniper must be predominant.
</p>

<p>
    New Western Dry Gins are basically defined, according to Ryan Magarian’s thesis on the subject of Gin and its style
    sub-categories, as Gins that, while embracing Juniper, focus as much or more on their complement of other botanicals,
    although no specific rules or legislation has yet been universally approved for this designation.
</p>


<h1>Gin - Applications</h1>
<p>
    While we can argue about the origins of the Martini, there is no argument that it was originally a gin drink. In the
    nineteenth century, the gin most Americans imbibed was Hollands, not Old Tom or London Dry. But in the last quarter of
    the 1800s, the trend was toward lighter, dryer drinks.
</p>

<p>
    Old Tom gin began to edge out genever. Mix Old Tom with vermouth and you have a Martini. Make that vermouth dry and
    switch the Old Tom for Plymouth or London dry gin, and you have a dry Martini, which was introduced in the 1890s. We’re
    still drinking it now.
</p>

<p>
    In America, during the manmade drought of Prohibition (1919- 1933), aged spirits were very expensive, if not downright
    unavailable. But homemade bathtub gin was as popular as the Charleston. It’s not hard to explain why that dance was all
    the rage, but gin was only a quick step away from moonshine. Gin demanded no long barrel aging and no exotic
    ingredients—just bootleg moonshine and some juniper extract purchased from Sears Roebuck’s, J.C. Penney’s or Montgomery
    Ward’s mail-order catalogues (all ranked such juniper products amongst their top ten sellers). Dozens of gin-based
    cocktails date from these years and have become classics. But gin’s spicy, ever-changing aromas and flavors are still
    too much for some drinkers and may provide too much of a challenge for lazy bartenders who find it easier to throw some
    juice together with vodka and call it a new classic. A shame and a wasted opportunity.

<h1>Tasting Gin</h1>
<p>
    Unlike vodka, gin is all about the aromas and flavors that are derived from botanicals. Compared to tasting vodka, gin
    is easy and straightforward. You smell it and you look for spices, fruits, vegetables and anything else you can think
    of, and if it’s an interesting gin, you’ll find a lot of each present.
</p>

<p>
    But as with vodka, a good taster looks to the base spirit. Is it rich, smooth, textured, or oily (in a good way)? Or is
    it hot, spiky and bitter? Some distillers, as if they were still making bathtub gin, figure that the botanicals will
    cover up lazy distillation. They won’t. The best way to find flavor and identify differences is to put a few gins next
    to each other. Smell, taste and compare them. While putting words to the differences still requires some artistic
    license, you will definitely find differences.
</p>


<h2>You’ll taste them to see if they are:</h2>

<ul>
• Clean or dirty
• Dry or slightly sweet
• Smooth or aggressive
• Gentle or powerful
• Fruity, floral, vegetal, earthy and/or herbal
• Rich or thin
• Soft, sharp or burning
</ul>
<p>
Gin should be clean and dry and not bitter and not sweet, unless it is a genever or genever-styled gin. A good genever
seems sweet from its powerfully malty character, and can indeed be gently sweet.
