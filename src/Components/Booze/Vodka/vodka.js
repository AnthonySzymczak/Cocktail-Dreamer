    <h1>Vodka - Where</h1>
    <p>
        Vodka is a type of distillate (as mentioned in Module I) that’s most synonymous with neutral grain spirit since
        it has been distilled to such a high proof that very few congeners,
        fusel oils, aromas and flavors remain. You can find vodka made anywhere and made from virtually anything. Russia
        and Poland were the most renowned and historically important early producers of vodka in large volumes.
        Russian and Polish filtration techniques, adopted in the late 1800s and early 1900s, has a great influence on
        the world’s other vodka producers, even if not practiced as rigorously in most other countries.
    </p>

    <h1>Vodka - What</h1>
    <p>
        Vodka is a spirit that has generally been distilled to higher than 95 percent alcohol by volume and then
        filtered.
        According to some ill-informed people, including the U.S. Government, this renders vodka an aroma-less and
        flavorless distilled spirit, which it is not.
        It is usually clear and colorless, although a few exceptions exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        This rough definition does not necessarily contradict the category of flavored vodka, which has been gaining
        market share for a decade or more.
        Flavored vodkas are neutral spirits that have been flavored, usually through the addition of flavor extracts
        purchased from a synthetic flavor and aroma manufacturer.
        Few producers use the real ingredients pictured on the label to gain their flavors and aromas because it is more
        challenging to produce a quality flavored vodka from natural ingredients than by procuring a vial of
        concentrated flavor.
        Natural ingredients are more expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are no limits on the raw materials that can be utilized to make vodka.
        Most people use common grains, like corn, rye and wheat, as well as vegetables and fruits, including potatoes,
        grapes and sugar beets, to distil to a very high proof (often 195-proof) and then cut the distillate with
        distilled water to 80-proof, or 40 percent alcohol by volume.
        Lately, higher proof vodkas are emerging in some markets. Their greater weight and intensity offers a talented
        bartender a chance to create more textured cocktails while retaining the sleek,
        congener-light character that was vodka’s original reason to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Filtration is part of the lore of vodka distillation. Some of it is real; some of it is sleight-of-hand.
        Gunnysacks, diamonds, silver, quartz, sand, paper, tightly woven cloth and, of course, charcoal (maple, birch)
        filters are often utilized to filter the distillate in an attempt to mellow or shape it,
        or for some merely an attempt to offer the marketing group more talking points in a sales meeting. Bear this in
        mind: the more distillations and filtrations,
        the more the characteristics of the base materials are stripped away.

    <h1>Vodka - When</h1>
    <p>
        Trying to figure out precisely when most spirits were created is more like a game of cards than it is a serious
        historical pursuit.
        Vodka is particularly elusive since the moment of origin (and its place of origin as well) depends upon how one
        defines it.
        Vodka, the word, appears to be a Russian diminutive of a Polish phrase, woda zycia, which means “water of life”.
        But the term vodka isn’t in usage until the late eighteenth century;
        distillation by then was commonplace and smartly practiced throughout Eastern Europe, but particularly in Russia
        and Poland.
        The earliest records in those countries date back to the 13th or even 12th centuries
        (though some believe distillation was happening centuries before); those distillates were made for medicines not
        beverages.
        Terms to describe the drinking beverage included gorzalka (from the Old Polish term gorzec, meaning ‘to burn’),
        okowita’ (derived from 'aqua vitae’ or “water of life’); the Russian terms translate as “burning wine” or “hot
        wine”.
        The records show that the nobility (who made the stuff for which some records were kept) initially distilled
        their vodka out of grapes or wine.
        That was a foolishly expensive way to make vodka when grains were widely available for the sustenance of their
        peoples and lands.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term “water of life” appears over and over again in the history of spirits: Eau de Vie (in French), Akvavit
        (in Danish), aqua vitae (in Latin) and even in the word “whiskey,” which derives from a Celtic term, uisce
        beatha. That “uisce” word was eventually slurred by English-speakers into the word “whiskey,” but remains an
        echo of the earlier “water of life”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea was that spirit or “water of life” was a purified form of water and, as we saw in Module I, it was
        safer to drink than most of the communal water. The Poles may have created vodka before the Russians, since the
        Russian word for it is a derivative of a Polish word, but you could probably be sent to Siberia for saying that.
        Indeed, Scandinavian producers may have participated in vodka’s earliest stages, as well, though fissionable
        materials will be dropped in your vodka tonic for repeating this story. Best to change the subject.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Russia, vodka remains a vital force and countless Russian leaders have utilized that power for political
        purposes. Ivan the Great nationalized all distilleries in 1474; Ivan the Terrible went further still and
        nationalized the bars where vodka was served in 1553. Why again is he considered great? Private distilleries
        persisted, but only amongst the wealthy and powerful. After the Russian Revolution, these distilleries were
        nationalized. Once Communism fell, President Boris Yeltsin was known to nip a glass or two but, most
        importantly, private enterprise returned to the business. Now, there is a profusion of new brands coming from
        the former Soviet Union, mostly owned by wealthy and powerful entrepreneurs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suffice it to say that for centuries vodka has represented Russian and Scandinavian culture, whether among the
        moneyed and powerful, or within the impoverished working classes. As an export product, vodka is relatively new.
        While some European bars, particularly in Paris, stocked it in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
        centuries, American bars barely knew what it was. Charles Baker’s Gentleman’s Companion, one of the most popular
        drink books of the 1930s, opined that “vodka is not necessary to a small or medium sized bar.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Vodka began seeping into the global mainstream first through Bohemian circles in Paris, London and New York,
        among which it had been growing in popularity since the turn of the twentieth century. In the 1940s, however,
        the exotic eastern European firewater captured the imagination of the Hollywood set and the rest is history. The
        stars had vodka parties, the Jet Set attended, and vodka became chic.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the mid-1950s, John Martin of Heublein, a major beverage supplier/distiller based in Connecticut, pushed
        vodka forward in the U. S. with Smirnoff Vodka, which was originally Russian. One of the most successful
        campaigns for their brand was, “Smirnoff...it will leave you breathless.” In the era of the three-martini lunch,
        this was a good thing if you planned to go back to work that afternoon.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the late 1950s, the Bloody Mary was a standard eye- opener (back when eye-openers were standard fare), the
        Screwdriver was a typical afternoon refresher, and those James Bond martinis were becoming cool to drink. By
        1967, vodka surpassed gin to become the number one white spirit in the U.S. In 1976, vodka became the number one
        spirit, white or brown. By the 1980s, what had happened in America was happening globally: vodka was edging out
        many of the traditional, local spirits.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why? Not because it leaves you breathless, but because it’s not supposed to have the kick and character of most
        other spirits, so you can have a drink without being bothered by flavor. While we’re not sure where the
        advantage in that is, that’s because we’ve learned to acquire the taste for those traditional spirits. For young
        drinkers who haven’t, vodka was and is tremendously alluring. No muss, no fuss, put it in a soft drink and boom,
        you’ve got booze! Manufacturers have been happy to encourage this trend, since vodka is far cheaper to produce
        than cognac, malt whiskey, rye, rhum agricole, oude genever, gin or any other traditional spirit.

    <h1>Tasting Vodka</h1>
    <p>
        Though vodka is a neutral spirit, one of the more remarkable aspects about tasting vodka is that, though as much
        flavor has been removed as possible, we tasters still find flavors. Having removed everything else, what should
        be left is yeast, water and the grain or other material from which the vodka is made.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vodka presents one of the greatest challenges you’ll have as a taster. But before you despair, put a few vodkas
        next to each other. Smell, taste and compare them. While putting words to the differences requires some artistic
        license, you will definitely find those differences.
    </p>

    <h2>You’ll taste them to see if they are:</h2>
    <ul>
        • Clean or dirty
        • Dry or slightly sweet
        • Smooth or aggressive
        • Gentle or powerful
        • Oily, grainy or soapy
        • Rich or thin
        • Soft, sharp or burning
    </ul>
    <p>
        It should taste like its ingredients, and that means it may smell and taste of bread dough (yeast, grain,
        nuttiness). It may taste even of minerals or of earthiness.
