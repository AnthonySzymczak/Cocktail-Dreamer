        <h1>Brandy - What</h1>
        <p>
            The term “brandy” is derived from the Dutch word for “burnt wine,” brandiwijn. Simply put, brandy is wine that has
            been distilled into a spirit and then aged in barrels. But, with centuries of human toil beside the still, brandy is
            a many-splendored thing. Brandy might be a very special old spirit, aged for decades in a place called Cognac, in
            western, coastal France. It might be a clear spirit often made from Muscat grapes in Peru near a seaside town called
            Pisco. It might be a clear distillate, called “eau de vie” (that’s “water of life”, if you’ve been paying attention,
            or even if you haven’t), made from raspberries, pears or cherries produced in Central and Western Europe.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, in the U.S. and some other countries, the word brandy can be used to describe a low-proof, sweetened
            and flavored spirit, often based upon neutral grain spirit and artificial flavoring—for example, “cherry brandy” or
            “apricot brandy” (historically, these would have had a brandy base).
        </p>

        <p>
            But for this module, we’ll focus on the good stuff. Moreover, we’ll break them all into two rough groups: unaged
            grape spirits and aged grape spirits. Unaged grape spirits include eaux-de-vie, grappa and marc (more about those
            below).
        </p>

        <p>
            Aged grape spirits include the basic category we call brandy, referring to a distilled wine that has been aged in
            oak for a specified time, usually at least six months or longer. These matured kinds include cognac (an area in
            central western France), armagnac (Gascony is another area in southwestern France) and calvados. Calvados is yet
            another area in France (Normandy in the northwest), but this one doesn’t use grapes to make its wine; it uses apples
            with a few pears thrown in for good measure.
        </p>

        <h1>Brandy – How</h1>
        <p>
            If you can ferment wine and boil it, you can make brandy, and perhaps some old-school grappas may remind some people
            of a drink that is that basic. But a smart distiller knows that the grapes or the juice from which a brandy is made
            has to be in great shape.
        </p>


        <h1>Unaged (Usually) International Wine Distillates</h1>

        <h1>Grappa – What</h1>
        <p>
            Grappa used to be hot, fiery stuff; we will admit that. But a few decades ago, a handful of smart distillers began
            producing high quality, delicious grappa, because they were careful with the grapes they used. In the past, grappa
            was something you distilled from “pomace,” which is the leftovers of winemaking. Most grappa distillers took grapes
            that had been dumped out of a fermenter after their juice had been made into wine, sprayed some water on them and
            threw the gooey mess—often with stems, seeds and all—into a still, usually after a couple of months of other sundry
            winery work. It’s not surprising that old-style grappa was coarse and weird.
        </p>

        <p>
            But a dynamic group of innovative distillers—Jacopo Poli, Antonella Bocchino, and Benito and Giannola Nonino come to
            mind—studied every aspect of grappa production in the 1970s to see if they could improve grappa production. The most
            important innovation they introduced was to rush the grape skins into the still as soon as they were removed from
            the fermenter. This change of tactic makes all the difference in the world; it produces grappas that taste
            remarkable fresh.
        </p>

        <p>
            And like skillful distillers the world over, they also carefully cut heads and tails, reserving the heart for
            bottling. The top grappas are expensive, it is true, but they are difficult and expensive to make correctly. This
            new generation of grappa producers has turned this once-ridiculed spirit into a world-class distillate category.
        </p>


        <h1>Pisco – What</h1>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, pisco is a distillate made from grapes and made in Chile or Peru. Each country has its own set
            of grapes from which they ferment wine and then distill pisco, but Peru definitely has the historical lead and a
            heck of a lot more material (different kinds of grapes) from which to distill. Peruvians also prefer the pot still
            while the Chileans lean toward continuous-still distillation. Pisco is far smoother than most grappas, because it is
            almost always made from distilled wine, and not from distilled grape-pomace.
        </p>


        <h1>Marc – What</h1>
        <p>
            Marc is a French spirit, a kind of grappa or pomace brandy made from leftover grapes and grape skins, only this time
            it’s made in France, much of it in the Burgundy region. There are other names the French use; ratafia is a common
            grappa-like spirit made in the Champagne region.
        </p>


        <h1>Aged Wine distillates, France: Cognac, Armagnac and Calvados</h1>

        <h1>Cognac – What</h1>
        <p>
            Cognac is a wine based brandy, made from Ugni Blanc grapes (there are very few other grape types grown in Cognac),
            twice distilled only in pot stills (a.k.a. alembic Charentais) and aged in Limousin (French) oak barrels for a
            minimum of two years. Even more importantly, Cognac is a place, where all these grapes must be grown and where this
            brandy must be aged. Cognac’s six demarcated growing districts are, in order of importance, Grande Champagne, Petite
            Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois and Bois à Terroirs. The two Champagnes are renowned for their
            chalky/limestone soil and account for what are the two longest-lived types of cognac, brandies that are especially
            deep and flavorful.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Ugni Blanc grape might be unfamiliar to you, but it’s Italy’s most widely grown grape, Trebbiano. It doesn’t
            have much flavor (try a Trebbiano from Italy and you’ll see what we mean) but it hangs on to its acidity and even
            after distillation can hang on to its fruit flavors. Indeed the chalky, limestone soils of the Cognac region are
            such that the brandies made from Cognac’s grapes continue to show fruitiness even after decades in bottle. Though
            there are lots of reasons why cognac can be truly great, the limestone soils are the chief reason that cognac ages
            so remarkably well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cognac, like many things having to do with the vine, can get really complicated when it comes to legal
            classifications. But remember that the main reason French wine (and cognac) has so many rules, regulations and
            titles is to make a consistent, trustworthy product and then to convince someone that it’s worth paying a lot of
            money for that. So a category of cognac such as XO, which stands for Extra Old, is controlled to the extent that
            customers around the world like to believe that any XO cognac they see is old and venerable. Sometimes it’s even
            true.
        </p>

        <p>
            The categories of cognac are VS (Very Special) or Three Star (aged at least two years in French oak barrels); VSOP
            (Very Superior Old Pale) or Five Star (aged at least four years in French oak barrels); and XO (Extra Old),
            Napoleon, Extra and Hors d’Age. This latter group has been aged in French oak barrels for at least six years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Isn’t it funny that they use English words (Very Special and the like) to name these very French brandies? Yeah,
            well, they know exactly to whom they are selling.
        </p>

        <h1>Armagnac – What</h1>
        <p>
            The balmy, rural and hilly Armagnac district (a.k.a. Gascogne) is southeast of Bordeaux. The Armagnaçais make their
            brandies differently than their peers in Cognac do, preferring to employ unique, hybrid two-column stills, some of
            which are attached to flatbeds and driven around the countryside by so-called “roving distillers.” Distillation
            range is from 52-72 percent alcohol by volume. Some smaller producers use pot stills only, while others use a
            combination of both styles of stills.
        </p>

        <p>
            They mostly use the prolific-growing, thick-canopied Ugni Blanc grape variety, along with far lesser amounts of
            Folle Blanche, Colombard and Baco. And they have minimum aging requirements in French oak barrels (black oak from
            the Monlezun forest), just like they do in Cognac. However, there are both continuous and pot stills in use in
            Armagnac, and many armagnac bottlings can seem a bit more rustic (and some would say interesting) than run-of-
            the-mill cognac.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some commercial armagnacs are made in similar fashion to cognac. Most are not, and these tend to be the more
            expensive versions. They can be a more herbal, a little citrusy and a lot less smooth than great cognac. But some
            people think smooth is boring.
        </p>

        <p>
            As with cognac, Armagnac has minimum aging requirements: for them, VS (Very Special) or Three Star is aged at least
            two years in French oak barrels; VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) or Five Star is aged at least five years in French
            oak barrels); and XO (Extra Old), Napoleon or Extra is aged at least six years in French oak. Hors d’Age Armagnac is
            a special category in Armagnac: it has slumbered in French oak barrels for at least ten years. As with cognac, the
            best producers exceed these minimum aging requirements by many years.
        </p>

        <p>
            One last note: don’t be fooled by people who tell you that the oldest armagnac (or cognac, for that matter) is the
            best. It depends upon your taste, and frankly, it depends upon the brandy. Some brandies taste wonderful when
            they’ve slept for twelve or fifteen years in a barrel. Some need twenty years to come to the loveliest balance of
            the fruit in the spirit and the spice and confection that comes from the barrel and the aging. Others break down
            chemically with excessive barrel aging. Just because it’s expensive and old doesn’t automatically mean that it’s
            legendary.
        </p>

        <h1>Calvados – What</h1>
        <p>
            Calvados, from northwest France, shares much of the same aging nomenclature: Fine, Three Star or Original Calvados
            must be aged in French oak casks for at least two years. Vieux or Réserve Calvados are aged in French oak casks for
            at least three years. Vieux Réserve, VO or VSOP Calvados are aged in French oak casks for at least four years. And
            the special categories of Hors d’Age, Extra, XO or Age Inconnu are aged in French oak casks for a minimum of six
            years.
        </p>

        <h1>Cognac, Armagnac, Calvados – Where</h1>
        <p>
            While most brandies could come from anywhere that grapes are grown and wine is made, the top brandies such as
            cognac, armagnac and calvados don’t seem to be vulnerable to imitation. There seems to be something unique that each
            region brings to the brandy they make, and each region prizes certain sub-zones far above others, though each is a
            part of the protected names embodied in the words cognac, armagnac and calvados.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cognac is divided into six sub-zones, called Bois à Terroirs, Bons Bois, Fins Bois, Borderies, Petite Champagne and
            Grand Champagne. Other than a small strip of land in the Fins Bois, the best cognacs are produced in the latter
            three regions, where the limestone is the oldest and the chalk content is the highest.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most cognac labels won’t list any particular region, but some do, and perhaps it indicates that the producer is
            rather proud of that cognac and where the grapes used to make it were grown. Many believe that Borderies provides a
            fat and even nutty character to cognac, while the longest-lived cognacs are grown in Grande Champagne, where the
            soil with the greatest content of chalk is found. If a district is cited on the label, the brandy must be 100
            percent from that district.
        </p>

        <p>
            But most cognacs are blends, skillful combinations of both greater and lesser regions. There is also a category
            called Fine Champagne or Grande Fine Champagne, and it represents a blend of Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne
            cognacs, with a minimum of 50 percent of the spirit coming from Grande Champagne.
        </p>

        <p>
            Armagnac has three demarcated production zones: Bas-Armagnac, which has clay and alluvial soils; Ténarèze, where the
            soil is a mix of clay and limestone; and Haut-Armagnac, which has more sand and limestone. Most people think the
            best armagnacs are grown in Bas-Armagnac because of their freshness and vivacity, but a lot of people love Ténarèze
            just as much because of their ability to mature for long periods.
        </p>

        <p>
            Calvados hails from the northwestern portion of France in beautiful Normandy and Brittany. Grapes don’t grow well in
            this cooler, even colder, seaside landscape but apples and pears do. Indeed there are dozens of species of each, and
            many distillers believe that it’s the myriad of species that make it possible to create a great apple-based brandy
            in this place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Again, they have broken the area into sub-zones, with Pays d’Auge considered the best area of Normandy and of
            Calvados’ demarcated areas. Pays d’Auge is an area that requires that the calvados there be distilled twice only in
            pot stills. The other two districts are Calvados AOC, the largest, all-encompassing region and the one with the
            least exciting brandies, and Calvados Domfrontais, where both apple and pear ciders (minimum of 30 percent pears)
            are distilled.
        </p>


        <h1>Cognac, Armagnac, Calvados – When</h1>
        <p>
            The Armagnaçais have gotten a raw deal. They preceded Cognac’s practice of distilling by a couple of centuries
            (probably the 1300s A.D.) and yet their sales represent a fraction of the sales of cognac worldwide. Sometimes being
            first isn’t good enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            Armagnac is a rural, heavily agricultural, and isolated place, while Cognac was the part of France that was owned by
            England for five hundred years. During that time, the British took feverishly to cognac, the brandy. Their turn as a
            world-dominant, nineteenth century power (it wasn’t so long ago that the phrase “the sun never sets upon the British
            Empire” was rampant because that empire encompassed the globe) meant that they shared their enthusiasm for the
            spirit with everybody else.
        </p>

        <p>
            Armagnac is the product of a part of France that has been, at times, Basque country. The Basque people are a
            fascinating breed. Some historians postulate that they are, in fact, a separate strain of human species. Regardless,
            the Basque regions of France and Spain have customarily been isolationist, if not actively hostile to outsiders for
            millennia.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cognac, on the other hand, didn’t practice distilling until the late sixteenth century, but within forty or fifty
            years was widely acclaimed for its great brandies and, ever since, for its great brandy marketing. The Cognaçais
            were quick to protect the name (lots of countries created imitation products called “conyac” and the like) and even
            quicker to understand that they needed to create a worldwide image of exclusivity and excellence in order to build a
            long-term market. It would be hard to fault their work, since many linguists consider “cognac” to be the most
            recognized French word around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Things went along swimmingly until the arrival of the vine-eating phylloxera louse into Europe’s vineyards in the
            1860s. The North American bug destroyed nearly all of Europe’s grape vines by 1880 and the remedy (grafting American
            vine stock onto established European vines) was difficult, labor-intensive and expensive, taking years to achieve.
            Meanwhile, whisky and gin took hold. As Winston Churchill once said, “My father drank brandy and soda. I drink
            whisky and soda.” The impact upon the brandy regions of France was huge. They grafted over to American stock as soon
            as they could, but many vineyard owners never recovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            They eventually recovered, even in the midst of world wars. While whisky sales remain the largest category of aged
            spirit sales, and vodka and soju (see glossary) remain the world’s largest spirit categories, nobody is starving in
            Cognac, at least not among the growers and distillers. Indeed, the running joke is that the rich folks and owners in
            Cognac all drive Mercedes and Jaguars. Everybody else has to make do with lowly BMWs or Peugeots.
        </p>

                            Tasting Brandy
                            Once you reach the pinnacle of brandies (great XO cognacs, armagnacs or calvados or even some Spanish and American
                            brandies), everything becomes a bit more difficult to distinguish. But that’s a good thing. If spirits are so
                            delicious and complex that you aren’t sure which one to love more, then you are a lucky taster indeed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But let’s start with the basics: what makes armagnac, cognac and calvados taste different from each other? Cognac is
                            usually smooth and refined, while armagnac is robust and assertive, and calvados is, well, apple-like and should be
                            the easiest to identify. And what makes an XO cognac so expensive and a VS cognac so (relatively) cheap? The answer
                            is the time spent in oak barrels, which costs the distiller more in tax and labor. Sensory evaluation-wise, it’s a
                            lot easier to spot flavors when there are identifiable differences between each of the brandies in front of you.
                        </p>
