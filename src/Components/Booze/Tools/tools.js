                    <h1>The Basic Bar Kit</h1>

                    <p>Give or take a speed pourer or two, a blender and one or two other items, the bartender’s basic armory— muddler, mixing
                        glass and mixing tin (aka Boston shaker), long-handled barspoon, jiggers of various sizes, spoon shaped julep strainer,
                        wire- rimmed Hawthorne strainer, citrus juicer, garnish knife and what have you—has remained unchanged for almost a
                        century and a half, an eloquent testimonial to the basic simplicity and efficiency of each item. With one or two
                        exceptions, though, we don’t know who to credit for any of the tools.</p>

                    <h1>The Muddler</h1>

                    <p>The oldest item in the kit (besides the garnish knife, which is as old as the hills) is the muddler, which goes back to
                        the time of the American Revolution.
                        Except for a nutmeg grater and a set of iron pokers for heating drinks, the “toddy
                        stick”—as it was then generally called— was practically the only specialized piece of equipment a barkeeper had. It had
                        two main functions: to crush the hard lumps that sugar came in at the time, and to stir the crushed sugar together with
                        water (hot or cold) and spirits to make a Toddy or Sling. </p>p
                    <p>Add a little mint-pressing (for Juleps) and its uses are
                        complete. The tip-tap it made as it rattled against the glass was a defining feature of the early American tavern and
                        fondly remembered by old-timers once it was supplanted by other tools. Toddy sticks were usually made of hardwood, but
                        examples made from silver or even gold were not unheard of.</p>

                    <h1>The Boston Shaker</h1>

                    <p>After ice made its way into the standard bar drinks in the 1830s, the barkeeper suddenly needed a set of picks, mallets
                        and scoops to separate the quantity needed from the large, unwieldy blocks it was sold in and get it into his customer’s
                        glass. Soon, Yankee ingenuity kicked in and changed the business of mixing drinks forever. </p>
                    <p>Rather than stirring them,
                        bartenders began pouring them back and forth between glasses, often held at a considerable distance apart (for some
                        reason, this seems to work better with a mixture of liquid and ice than with liquid alone); today, a much more
                        conservative version of this method is called “rolling” a drink, and it is generally reserved for Bloody Marys or other
                        drinks that foam when shaken. For obvious reasons, a flared glass was preferred for this operation.</p>
                    <p>This technique was fine, even spectacular, provided everything in the drink wanted to mix easily. Eggs, slices of
                        citrus, berries, milk and cream all caused problems—as did the basic difficulty of pulling this stunt off.
                        A solution was found some point before 1848, when a New York writer described a bartender “pulling long ribbons of julep out of a
                        tin cup.” Jam a light metal cup (tin, brass or silver—stainless steel was a thing of the future) over your glass and
                        shake as hard as you want. This two-piece contraption (mixing glass and metal shaker to cover) is known as a Boston
                        shaker these days, but the exact nature of its connection to the city on the Charles is lost.</p>
                    <p>The Boston shaker offers many advantages, which we’ll get into below, and only a couple of disadvantages. One, it
                        requires a strainer, unless you want to crack it open sideways and let the liquid trickle out (something bartenders have
                        been doing since the 1860s at least) or strain the drink through your fingers. </p>
                    <p>The first way is tricky and slow, while only bartenders of practically divine physical attractiveness can get away with the second, and then only for customers
                        who are susceptible to their charms. The rest of us need some kind of strainer. The other problem with the Boston shaker
                        is that the glass part is a poor conductor of heat and a drink made in it won’t be quite as cold as one made purely in
                        metal (for this reason, many modern bars prefer to use a smaller mixing tin or “cheater tin” in place of the glass).</p>
                    <p>Recently a wave of serious mixologists, dubbed cocktailians by author gaz regan, have begun to employ a Boston shaker
                        with two metal parts in an attempt to achieve the coldest possible drink.
                        Cocktailian bartenders are trained in jigger service, and ingredients are carefully measured to assure a consistent drink. But a majority of the bar community are
                        still free pour servers who seldom, if ever, use jiggers, and many have developed considerable skill at both counting
                        and using hand-eye coordination to achieve consistent drinks.</p>
                    <p>This style of bartending requires the server to use the
                        glass and metal shaker, especially with fresh juice sour drinks. Sour ingredients followed by sweet ingredients,
                        followed by the strong and flavoring ingredients. The ice is added last to allow the bartender to see the levels of
                        sour, sweet and strong and achieve a balanced drink. In the view of many professionals, using all metal Boston shakers
                        for this type of mixology will rob the user of the visual aspect of their skill and can make a fresh sour drink
                        impossible to prepare by the free-pour method.</p>
                    <p>From the late 1880s on up to approximately last week, these disadvantages, minor as they are, have spurred inventors on
                        to come up with the “perfect” cocktail shaker. At first, their efforts took the form of attaching various straining bits
                        onto the mixing tin. In the 1880s, the now-standard three-piece “Cobbler” or “combination” shaker used by home hobbyists
                        and a few bars here and there was introduced by E. J. Hauck, a Brooklyn tin-ware manufacturer. Hauck’s basic invention,
                        with its mixing tin, cover with built-in strainer and sealing cap, has been subject to countless refinements, but when
                        all is said and done most bartenders still prefer the flexibility, simplicity and cheapness of the old Boston shaker.</p>

                    <h1>The Julep and Hawthorne Strainers</h1>

                    <p>With the Boston shaker, you need a strainer. The nineteenth century saw two kinds developed. The simplest and oldest
                    goes back to the middle of the century, when bartenders began using perforated, scallop shell shaped tea-strainers to
                    scoop their ice and strain their drinks. Eventually, manufactures began making these specifically for the bar, enlarging
                    the bowl and giving it an oval shape. Today, this is called a julep strainer (oddly, since you don’t strain a Julep; the
                    name comes from the early practice of serving the drink with the strainer in it, for the customer to use to hold the ice
                    back from his teeth).</p>
                <p>The problem with the Julep strainer is that it’s not very flexible—it fits one size of glass and
                    one size only (and that glass can’t be overly full, either). Around 1890,Yankee ingenuity finally kicked in and
                    supplanted it with the “Hawthorne strainer”—the paddle- shaped device with the spring around the edge that fits over
                    either the glass or the tin part of the shaker.</p>
                <p>Tradition-minded mixologists will use the julep strainer for drinks stirred in the mixing glass and the Hawthorne
                    strainer for shaken drinks, which are poured from the mixing tin.</p>

                <h1>The Barspoon</h1>

                <p>Not all drinks are shaken; traditionally, some are stirred. This custom goes back to the end of the nineteenth century,
                    when the art of mixing drinks made another one of its periodic turns of the wheel. The shaking that had been so modern a
                    couple of generations before was now old-fashioned, and stirring was all the rage.</p>
                <p>In part, this was due to the general replacement of granulated sugar with simple syrup (much easier to blend); in part,
                    it was because the most popular drinks—Martinis, Manhattans—required no vigorous mixing for the ingredients to meld.
                    What’s more, without the little bubbles shaking introduces, these drinks take on a heavy, silky texture that is most
                    pleasing to the palate.</p>
                <p>Truth be told, though, in part it was also because the bartenders didn’t want to be seen breaking a sweat. In any case,
                    this time the old toddy stick was out, except in making Old Fashioneds, where everything had to be done the
                    old-fashioned way, and the new barspoon was in—more or less the same long-handled spoon we know today, with its small
                    bowl and twisted handle. This allowed drinks to be mixed with a simple and effortless-looking motion of the wrist, very
                    cool.</p>
                <p>The European barspoon differs from the American one in that it has a flat, muddling disc on the end of the handle. This
                    was originally a French design, the disc being used for crushing sugar to make eau sucrée or sugar-water, popular in the
                    nineteenth century.</p>

                <h1>The Jigger</h1>

                <p>Great bartenders have always recognized the importance of accurate measuring, particularly when it comes to making
                    complex cocktails. Originally, bartenders used standard glassware for this purpose. The base measure was a “wineglass,”
                    by which was meant a V-shaped, stemmed sherry glass that held about 2 ounces or 60-ml. Backing this up was the 1
                    ounce/30-ml liqueur glass, or “pony.” These glasses were inconsistent in size and easily broken.</p>
                <p>Sometime around 1870, somebody had the bright idea of replicating the little conical sherry glass in metal, so it could
                    be stamped out at a consistent size and wouldn’t break. Before long, somebody else took this “jigger”—a word that
                    basically meant “whatchamacallit”—and mounted it back-to-back with a pony-sized version. Done, or at least almost done:
                    the standard 2 ounce/60-ml size proved too large for some bars, and by the early twentieth century, these were also
                    being made in 1 ½ ounce/45ml and 1 ¼ ounce/37 ml sizes.</p>
                <p>Bartenders should make certain that jiggers crafted by different
                    companies are uniform in their precise measurements. This means that when you have two or more styles of jiggers in your
                    bar, you make sure that all, say, ½ ounce jiggers are indeed precisely one-half ounce. Test your jiggers for accuracy.
                    8:45</p>

                <h1>Juicers</h1>

                <p>We won’t get into the history of the juicer here beyond observing that the modern two-handled hand version has been in
                    use in one form or another for well over a century (the earliest were made of wood or cast iron and porcelain) and is
                    still the best way to produce juice to order.</p>

                <h1>Other Tools</h1>

                <p>These are not of course the only tools a serious mixologist will be familiar with. A truly comprehensive bar kit will
                    include dozens of other items, from simple things like knives of various sizes, a cherry pitter, a fine mesh strainer
                    (for drinks with muddled fruit) and a few dasher-topped bitters bottles to more elaborate items such as cut-glass
                    stirring glasses, an electric blender, a steel whipped-cream canister and a vacuum filter for bitters making. And, of
                    course, a bottle opener and a lot of bar towels.</p>
