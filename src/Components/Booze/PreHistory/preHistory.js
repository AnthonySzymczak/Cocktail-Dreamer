    <p>In 700 B.C., when guests at the funeral of King Midas of Phrygia (in what is modern Turkey) were served a mixture
    of wine, mead—fermented honey-water—and barley beer, the mixed drink was already ancient. </p>
<p>Since the dawn of history, people have been taking one liquid and another liquid and asking themselves “what
    happens if I mix this with this?”
    Some of their early experiments sound odd to the modern ear. </p>
<p>In Homer’s Iliad, for instance, we find his epic heroes at one point drinking Pramnian wine mixed with grated
    goat cheese and barley meal. Hardly our idea of a cocktail, although
    stranger things have been labeled as such (the Cement Mixer, anyone?). In general, though, it’s safe to say that
    the bulk of ancient drinking was far more conservative: strong wine and water, beer or mead straight —
    salt-of-the-earth stuff like that.</p>
<p>The spread of distilling in the late Middle Ages added new drive to the art of mixology. Distilled spirits were
    strong and fiery and (since long aging in oak was a thing of the future) pretty raw.</p>
<p>Various ways of cooling their heat were
    tried — flavoring them with pungent herbs and heavily sweetening them, mixing them with wine, with beer, with
    water or even filtering them.</p>
<p>The first true triumph of the art of taming spirits didn’t occur until the early seventeenth century, in India.
    “Punch,” which is supposedly derived from “panch,” the Farsi and Hindi word for “five,” is traditionally made with five
    elements
    [liquor, sugar of some sort, citrus juice, tea (or other spice) and water].</p>
<p>We don’t know if it was a native Indian drink or, as the evidence suggests is far more likely, one that sailors
    and merchants associated with the English East
    India Company put together themselves from Indian ingredients (as early as the 1570s, the Elizabethan writer
    George Gascoyne had observed his countrymen drinking their wine mixed with sugar, spices and lemon juice; the
    substitution of local firewater cut with H2O in place of the unavailable wine would’ve been a natural one).</p>
<p>In any case, by the end of the seventeenth century a bowl of Punch was one of the most popular tipples in England
    and its colonies. Usually, this was served hot, the English climate being the English climate. But punch is
    versatile; when necessary, boiling water was replaced with ice (when that then-precious commodity was available) or at least
    cool water.</p>

<p>Now, the alert student of mixology will note that aside from being made by the bowl instead of by the glass, this
    punch stuff resembles a modern cocktail, like the Daiquiri, the Margarita or the Cosmopolitan. Indeed, in the hands of
    James Ashley, who kept a famous Punch-house on Ludgate Hill in London from 1731 until his death in 1776, it was even
    closer to those drinks than you might imagine, since he sold it in quantities as small as a single cup. Ashley, by the
    way, was the world’s first celebrity mixologist.</p>
<p>By the first decades of the nineteenth century, the best punchmakers— not just Englishmen at this point, but
    English women as well, and men and women from Scotland, Ireland, Paris (a particular hotbed of Punch innovation),
    Germany and, of course, the former British colonies across the Atlantic—had picked up a host of tricks with which to improve
    (or “improve”) the simple beverage of the East India Company: supplementing the sugar with flavored syrups or
    liqueurs, smoothing things out by adding emulsifiers such as gum Arabic, maidenhair fern, egg whites or milk (which was
    generally allowed to curdle, with the solids being strained out), replacing the water with tea or wine or even champagne,
    deploying carefully-calibrated combinations of base spirits, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be no large exaggeration to say that all the building blocks of mixology as we understand it now
    were basically in place by 1800.</p>
