    Whisk(e)y - What
</h1>
<p>
    Earlier we wrote that the word whiskey is derived from the Gaelic term “uisce beatha”, which means “water of life.”
    But the term whiskey, as it’s spelled both in Ireland and the U.S. (“whisky’, if you’re in Scotland, Canada or
    Japan— although it’s worth noting that this convention is recent and completely arbitrary) connotes that a grain
    spirit has been aged in oak long enough to take on new aromas and flavors, most of which come from the barrel
    itself. These smoky, spicy notes define the taste of whiskey (the generic spelling we’ll use for convenience) for
    most people.
</p>

<p>
    As so often with rules, the time required in barrel for a grain spirit to earn the title of “whiskey” varies from
    country to country. While differences other than barrel aging requirements exist among the world’s many whiskeys, it
    is a whiskey’s time in barrel that does the most to define it. Most whiskey distillers postulate that up to 70
    percent of the flavor of their whiskey comes from the barrel in which it is matured.
</p>

<p>
    We’ll also address the issue of where the barrel has been aged, but for the moment, it’s enough to state upfront
    that every whiskey in the world is made from only three easily obtained ingredients: grain, water and yeast.
</p>

<p>
    Whiskey is a grain spirit that has been distilled in continuous and/or pot stills and that is aged in barrels for
    some specified period of time. In its essence, it is a beer that has been distilled to high proof and then aged in
    oak. A recent trend in the U.S. involves small, artisanal (as they identify themselves, often accurately)
    distilleries marketing white or unaged whiskey. To date, there has been no breakthrough product of this description,
    but it bears observing.
</p>

<h1>
    Whisk(e)y – Where
</h1>
    <p>
        Whiskey is made all over the world. One way to think of whiskey production is that anywhere that beer is made,
        whiskey can be made.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the U.S., North American blended whiskey (see below) is the number one category of whiskey in sales volume;
        Canadian whisky is close behind. However, in the U.S., the fastest growing spirit category of all since 2000 has
        been Irish whiskey. In 2009, Irish whiskey again enjoyed double-digit growth, from San Francisco to Boston. In
        Scotch whisky, single-malt whisky sales remain strong while blended whisky sales (see below for definitions) are
        stable. Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales are robust, though bourbon is only now gaining the dominance and
        reputation it so surely deserves.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Great Britain, Scotch whisky dominates the market, as it does in much of the world. In Ireland, though, it is of
        course Irish whiskey that rules as this dynamic industry expands. The addition of a fourth whiskey distillery,
        Kilbeggan, brings new hope and inspiration to Irish whiskey’s international audience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other, non-English speaking countries also produce whiskey; none are more deserving of our attention than Japan,
        though Japanese whisky (as they spell it) will remain little known for the foreseeable future. There are also
        quality whiskeys from Brittany in France (a Celtic area), Germany, Sweden, Austria, Australia and India.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of the major whiskey-making countries, only Scotland makes a big noise about the particular district or area where a
        distillery sits. Why? Because with all but a handful of other spirits (cognac, armagnac, tequila and mezcal), where
        a spirit is distilled doesn’t have a profound impact upon the flavors in that spirit. Indeed, with Tequila and
        mezcal the region where the agaves are grown is far more important than the particular location of the distillery.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Scotland, though, the distillery’s address has something to do with the flavors in the whisky. We can argue as to
        why. Is it the water they use? Is it the temperature of the water they use? Is it the proximity to the ocean and the
        preponderance of the salty, briny sea air on some islands? These are no small details because they impact the
        character of many blended and single-malt Scotch whiskies. In other words, the whiskies from The Glenlivet
        Distillery in Speyside are unique and emblematic of that particular place in the Scottish Highlands.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some outdated books divide Scotland’s distillery regions into groups such as Speyside (a classic area around the
        Spey River in east-central Scotland), the Lowlands (where all those grain whiskies are made), the Western Highlands
        (some of them are fairly fruity, but isn’t that from the old wine barrels they use?), the Islands (with their briny,
        salty, sea air derived intensity) and Campbeltown (with a touch of everything to it).
    </p>

    <p>
        Paul Pacult, one of BAR’s partners, knows a good deal more about these things than most other living humans, and he
        no longer buys into such a fragmentation. For Paul, it’s as simple as talking about inland distilleries (they tend
        to be a bit more elegant and often show the peppery floral note redolent of heather flowers and other vegetation)
        and the maritime distilleries that so often burst with the aromas of the ocean. Everything else is due to something
        other than location.
    </p>

<h1>
    Whisk(e)y – When
    </h1>
    <p>
        If Scotch whisky is viewed as a benchmark of whiskey making, it’s worth noting that a century ago, Irish whiskey was
        king. That’s not to say that whiskey in Ireland necessarily preceded whisky in Scotland since the actual history of
        each is sketchy. There are lots of hints at spirit production in Ireland possibly as early as the twelfth century
        A.D. and in Scotland by the thirteenth century, but the first irrefutable proof is a Scottish tax record from
        A.D.1494: “To Friar John Cor, by the order of the King, to make aqua vitae, eight bolls of malt.” The good friar
        wasn’t cooking up a little medicine for scrapes and cuts; eight bolls is the equivalent of over 1,100 pounds of
        malted barley. Somebody was thirsty.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consequently, bits of circumstantial evidence point to the leap of faith that there must have been substantial
        distillation happening prior to that record, albeit smaller, less commercial endeavors. Some historians believe that
        Irish Celtic monks visited the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) some years before Friar John was filling his
        still and brought back with them the secrets of boiling fermented liquids. The Muslim rulers of Spain and Portugal
        were well versed in the distilling arts, and their alchemists made medicines and perfumes in their stills.
    </p>

    <p>
        It stands to reason with current knowledge that Irish travelers, perhaps clergy, brought the concept back to Eire,
        where monasteries were the sites of large-scale beer brewing (as well as cheese making and other necessities of
        life). At some point, monks began distilling their beers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many historians, including BAR’s resident whiskey maven Pacult, believe that the Irish brought the concept of
        distillation to the Scots, possibly in either the thirteenth or fourteenth century.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In any case, by the middle of the 1500s, when it was still something of a rarity in Scotland, whiskey was so well
        established as the drink of the Irish people that the English occupying authorities felt the need to pass
        regulations against its excessive use. Eventually, the English wised up to the revenue potential of this new
        industry. That fact goes a long way toward explaining how until recently distillation was a cottage industry in both
        Ireland and Scotland. The health and vigor of both countries’ spirits industries were purposefully hampered by
        British tax laws. As little more than colonies of England, the two were not supposed to offer any competition to
        England’s wares. Taxes and tariffs saw to that.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        One notable Scottish exception is Ferintosh, a distillery along the Scotland’s eastern coast. During one of
        Scotland’s many brief and bloody rebellions, the owners of Ferintosh threw their lot in with the English Crown. From
        1690 to 1784, when the excise law was changed, Ferintosh was alone in being allowed to export its Scotch whisky to
        England. The rest were welcome to consume their whisky and to trade it with their neighbors, so long as they paid an
        onerous tax upon every drop they distilled. But they were never to export it to the outside world, unless they first
        paid taxes and then sold it to an English middleman, who would earn all the profits.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In the years before the laws were changed in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, thousands of Scots were
        imprisoned for producing and/or smuggling spirit to England and Europe by land or sea. By 1824, much of the illegal
        activity was quelled by changes in Parliamentary legislation that made it easier and cheaper to become fully
        licensed. Unsurprisingly, smuggling convictions plummeted by the 1840s.
    </p>  

    <p>
        Not everyone was happy with the new rules. In order to produce whisky, a distillery had to purchase a license, and
        the license came with some strings. For one, you had to house and feed an exciseman (tax collector) on your premises
        so that the Crown could be assured that you weren’t playing any games with those rules. That was bad enough. But
        housing a government man on your property meant that all your neighbors had to either go legal and buy a permit (and
        house a revenue man of their very own) or give up distilling illegally, as some had been doing for centuries.
        George Smith, proprietor of The Glenlivet Distillery, so angered his fellow Speyside distillers that he traveled
        (and even slept) with a pair of pistols at his side. It wasn’t bluster; some of his neighbors swore bloody revenge
        for bringing the government into their midst along the river Livet. The pistols came in handy; there are two
        well-known episodes during which they saved his life.
    </p>

    <p>
        But Parliament had finally ended most illegal distillation in Scotland and planted the seeds of a mighty global
        industry. Still, Scotch whisky was more or less a small cottage industry until the development of continuous stills.
        Those stills were fired up and cranking out neutral grain spirit in the Lowlands, and it only took a few
        enterprising individuals to utilize the cheaper, neutral spirit in the pursuit of a cheaper, easier way to sell
        spirit.
        Their names are still common today: Andrew Usher, Chivas, Johnnie Walker, Ballantine, Dewar, Buchanan and a number
        of other grocer/merchants who simply wanted to blend their purchased single-malt whisky barrels into something very
        consistent, affordable, large scale and, well, brand-able. In other words, they could create a whisky, put their
        names on it and never have to do anything other than go shopping.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clearly, it worked. In 1901 a British court decided that any whisky created in Scotland could theoretically be
        called Scotch whisky, regardless of whether it was made in a pot still (like single malt) or a continuous still
        (like grain whisky). Since then, blended Scotch whisky sales have crushed the sales of single malts, and today dwarf
        the whisky sales of any other country’s output.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, in Ireland, things developed rather differently, to the point that, thirty years ago, the industry was
        dying. After a wildly prosperous nineteenth century, when the distilleries of Dublin, Belfast and Cork turned out
        vast quantities of high-quality pure pot-still whiskey, both to supply a massive domestic market for export to
        America and all corners of the British Empire, the twentieth century hit the Irish distillers like a sock full of
        shillings—the Irish Rebellion of 1916, Prohibition in America, two world wars, a worldwide depression, the Troubles
        in the North, heavy emigration from the Republic and a domestic shift away from whiskey to the cheaper beer. The
        list of commercial disasters and misfortunes is a long one.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        By 1980, the thirty working distilleries that the island had supported in 1900 had been culled to just two, both of
        them owned by the same company: Bushmills in Northern Ireland, which made Old Bushmills, and the Midleton Distillery
        in County Cork in the Irish Republic, which made everything else, from Jameson’s to Power’s to Paddy to Redbreast.
        Long-established distilleries such as Locke in Kilbeggan, which had been in operation since the mid-eighteenth
        century, were closed and silent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Neither of the working distilleries was much interested in the kinds of well-aged top-shelf bottlings that appeal to
        whiskey connoisseurs. They focused instead on lighter, younger blended whiskeys that were priced to compete with
        Johnnie Walker Red Label, White Horse, Dewars and all the other Scotch blends that had dominated the world market
        for Celtic whiskey since the turn of the century. Now, there’s nothing wrong with blended whiskeys, per se. But
        there is an irony here: the whole reason the Scots turned to making them in the first place, back in the
        mid-nineteenth century, was to have something more like what their cousins across the Irish Sea were selling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Traditional Scotch whisky, as we’ve seen, was the sort of thing that those who loved it loved well, but it
        definitely wasn’t for everybody. The solution Scotland’s whisky-merchants hit upon was blending. The Irish, on the
        other hand, had no need to monkey around with blending and column stills (while column stills were in operation,
        particularly in Ulster, their product was marked for export and didn’t find its way into Irish whiskey until the
        mid-twentieth century).
    </p>

    <p>
        Irish distilling boasted a number of differences from the Scots in the way they did things such as much larger pot
        stills, which yield a lighter spirit and triple distillation (likewise), and the use of hot air rather than peat
        smoke to dry their malt also made for a whiskey that was smoother and cleaner-tasting (and cheaper to make) than
        Scottish pot-still whisky. Yet, Irish whiskeys had far more body and flavor than the insipid grain
        whiskey—particularly since Irish distillers generally mixed their malted barley with raw barley, oats and rye, which
        gave it a pleasing, spicy graininess. On the strength of this, Irish distillers were able to resist the economic
        advantages of blending until the late 1930s, when they were finally forced to install continuous stills.
    </p>

<h1>
    Whisk(e)y – How
</h1>
<p>
    Rules and traditions vary from country to country, so it’s best to take whiskey data one country at a time in this
    order: Scotland, Ireland, United States and Canada.
</p>


    <h2>Whisky – Scotland</h2>
    <p>
        Scotland is justly viewed as the epicenter of whisky making in the world. Walk into a bar anywhere (outside of the
        U.S. and Ireland) and if you ask for a whisky, the bartender will point at a wall of Scotch bottles. What precisely
        are they showing you?
    </p>

    <p>
        Scotch is a distilled and aged in wood grain spirit: distilled either from relatively inexpensive grains (such as
        corn or wheat) or from malted barley. If you’ve double- (or occasionally triple-) distilled the barley beer in pot
        stills at a single distillery, the whisky you make from that malted barley beer is called a single-malt whisky.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you’re using corn or wheat, you’re probably using continuous stills and distilling to neutral grain spirit levels
        (say 190-proof or so). In other words, you’re starting to close in on vodka territory. But regardless, if you aged
        that spirit into a whisky, you would call that whisky a grain whisky because you made it from a grain, and not from
        malted barley or “malt.”
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Back in the production module, we discussed how beer was made: grains were allowed to become warm and wet, and they
        would sprout, believing spring to be at hand. As they prepared to sprout, latent starches would be converted into
        sugars. The brewmaster would roast the grains at that very moment, in order to halt the sprouting process and
        capture those sugars. The grains would then be ground up and boiling water added, and the sugary cereal/soup would
        be ready for yeasts to convert those sugars into alcohol.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In beer production, the amount of time the grains are roasted helps determine the style of beer. Dark beers such as
        Guinness have been roasted until they are dark and chocolaty. In Scotch production, the roasting can be equally
        influential. Here’s why: for much of Scotland’s history, the only fuel they had available was peat; coal was too
        expensive and forests were cleared for farming by the time the Romans invaded Britain in the first century B.C. Peat
        is compressed vegetation that’s halfway to becoming coal. Damp, it’s cut from the ground and allowed to dry. When
        you burn it, it’s intensely smoky.
    </p>

    <p>
        So malted barley used for Scotch has traditionally been roasted over smoky fires, and the resultant whisky smells
        smoky. There’s no other word for it, though we spirits writers like to talk about the brine and the salt and the
        earth and the leather and the smell of the sea. But we’re mostly just talking about the smokiness imparted to the
        grain during the roasting. It’s important to bear in mind, however, that not all Scotch whisky is made from
        peat-smoked barley.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scotch production regulations are particular about the grains you use. When the semi-sprouted and roasted grain is
        barley, it’s referred to as malted barley; in Scotland, a “malt whisky” can be made only from malted barley. If any
        other grains are used, it must be called “grain whisky.” If the malt whisky comes from a single distillery (as
        opposed to blends from several distilleries), it’s called a “single-malt whisky”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The vast majority of Scotch whiskies (95 percent) sold in the U.S. and the rest of the world are not single malt
        whiskies. They are “blended Scotch whiskies.” A blended Scotch whisky comprises at least one single-malt whisky and
        a large dose of grain whisky.
    </p>

    <p>
        This may seem confusing, so hang on. You already know what a single-malt whisky is. Great blended Scotch whiskies
        have many single malt whiskies blended into them; the idea is to capture as much complexity as possible by adding a
        bit from some of the best distilleries around Scotland, from legendary places such as Speyside, Campbeltown and the
        islands. But almost all of the blended Scotch whiskies have far more grain whisky than single-malt whisky in them.
        So a very serious blended whisky may be comprised of 40 percent single malts (from a bunch of places, to gain
        complexity) and 60 percent grain whisky. A blended Scotch whisky intended for the well in someone’s bar probably has
        only 10 or 20 percent single malt-whisky in it.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the grain whisky is a huge factor in blended Scotch whisky. And most grain whiskies are distilled to the sort of
        proof that we associate with vodka. In other words, most grain whiskies don’t have a lot of flavors and aromas, at
        least not compared to single-malt whiskies. That said, without the filtration and multiple distillations that vodka
        undergoes, they still manage to retain some grain flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
        But here’s the kicker, single-malt whiskies have too much flavor for a lot of people. One hundred and fifty years
        ago, there were few blended Scotch whiskies, and few people outside of Great Britain drank Scotch. Once distillers
        began dumping grain whisky into those powerful and flavorful single malt whiskies, well, then sales started to
        really take off. Blended Scotch, it can be stated, turned Scotch whisky into a national industry with global
        implications.
    </p>

    <p>
        And if single-malt whiskies are much sought after for their often intense personalities, it’s worth remembering that
        a great blended whisky contains a lot of those personalities, softened with a dose of grain whisky. Sure, the single
        malt might be more singular, but the community of personalities contained in a great blended whisky is likely to be
        far more complex than a single malt. Don’t be a whisky snob!
    </p>


    <h3>So the categories of Scotch whisky are:</h3>

<ol>
    -Single Malt-Whisky: a whisky made of malted barley, double distilled in pot stills (only one malt distillery,
    Auchentoshan in the Scottish Lowlands, triple distills) at one distillery, distilled no higher than 70 percent abv,
    and aged in oak barrels for a legal minimum of three years. At present there are about 100 malt distilleries
    operating around Scotland.


    -Blended Scotch Whisky: a whisky made of malt whisky (double distilled in pot stills) and grain whisky (probably
    distilled in continuous stills to a very high proof) and aged in oak barrels for a legal minimum of three years.


    -Blended Malt Whisky (formerly known as Vatted Malt Whisky): a blend composed only of at least two single-malt
    whiskies, instead of products of only one (single) distillery, and aged in oak barrels for a legal minimum of three
    years.


    -Grain Whisky: a whisky distilled from any grain (typically either wheat or corn), usually in continuous stills, and
    aged in oak barrels for a legal minimum of three years. There are around eight grain distilleries in Scotland.
</ol>
    <p>
        Barrel usage and selection are crucial. You will most frequently see used bourbon barrels, but there are many
        producers who love to add the dried fruit characteristics that can be leached out of used sherry barrels. In truth,
        sherry barrels were adopted a century ago, because all sherry was once shipped to England in barrels (not in bottles
        as is legally required today) and the empty barrels were cheap and plentiful. While used bourbon barrels are still
        relatively cheap, used sherry barrels are not. Sherry producers no longer ship their product in barrels and
        typically don’t want new barrel aromas and flavors; they’re perfectly content to keep using the old barrels until
        they break.
    </p>

    <p>
        By law, all whiskies made in Scotland must be aged in wood barrels for a minimum of three years, though most are
        aged for much longer. So Scotch producers have to buy the barrels new and loan them to the sherry makers, who will
        hand them over after a decade or two of use. Just for the record, they make the Scotch producers pay for shipping
        too. Not a bad deal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, two other salient points regarding Scotch whisky. One, the age statement on the bottle (18 Years Old, 21Years
        Old, for example) is the age of the youngest whisky used in that particular bottling, no matter the type of Scotch
        whisky. Two, in addition to the normal bottlings of single malts issued directly by distilleries, there is, of late,
        another type of single-malt offering, called merchant bottlings. These are whiskies that have been purchased by the
        barrel from brokers or malt distilleries and then aged and bottled by independent merchants/agents, such as Gordon &
        MacPhail, Duncan Taylor, Scott’s Selections, Cadenhead’s, Compass Box, Murray McDavid and many others. What makes
        these offerings intriguing is whether or not they mirror the established style of the distillery. Anyway, be aware
        of them for your customers’ education.
