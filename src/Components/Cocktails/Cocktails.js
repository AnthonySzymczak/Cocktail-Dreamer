                            The original added a dash of crème de violette for a sky-blue color, which helps to explain the name (you can use Monin violet syrup if crème de violette isn’t available).

                    4) Bloody Mary (Original Recipe) [1920-1930]
                </h2>
<p>
                As the story goes, the Bloody Mary was invented at the legendary (and still-standing) Harry’s New York Bar in Paris in the early 1920s, when bartender Ferdinand “Pete” Petiot poured vodka
                (popular in Paris due to the large number of Russians taking refuge there from the Bolshevik Revolution) into a glass of tomato juice, newly imported in cans from the United States. In 1934, the story continues,
                Petiot brought the drink to America, when—Prohibition having just been repealed—he became head bartender at New York’s St. Regis Hotel. It was at this point that he added the spices the drink contains today—the lemon juice,
                the Worcestershire, the Tabasco, the salt and pepper; in fact, the only thing to distinguish it from the modern Bloody Mary is the name, which had to be changed to Red Snapper (the other was thought vulgar)
                and the fact that it had to be made with gin, as vodka wasn’t yet available in the US.
</p>
<p>
                Well, at least some of this is true. Pete Petiot did work at Harry’s in the early 1920s and at the St. Regis in the 1930s (and 40s, 50s and 60s).
                You could get both vodka and tomato juice in Paris at some point in the 1920s, anyway. But tomato juice had been a popular hangover cure in America for a long time.
                What’s more, in the late 1920s, the people responsible for marketing the stuff began widely publicizing an alcohol-free “Tomato Juice Cocktail” designed to give a bit of the bite of an alcoholic drink,
                without anything illegal in it. Its ingredients? Tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper.
                It didn’t take much inventing to add a little alcohol to that. Add a number of other claimants to the invention and some later hedging and hemming and hawing from Petiot,
                and a clear story turns very murky. One thing we do know for sure is that the combination of vodka and tomato juice, however you named it and whatever else you added to it, was well-established as a hangover drink by the late 1930s.
                One other thing we also know is that Pete Petiot was one hell of a great bartender, whether he invented the Bloody Mary or merely facilitated its acceptance.

                    <li class="list-disc list-style-type: disc">¼ oz. fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li class="list-disc list-style-type: disc">4 oz. tomato juice</li>
<br/>
                    <p>Preparation: Combine all ingredients in mixing glass and roll back and forth into tin to mix (that will prevent the tomato juice from foaming). Strain into an iced goblet. Garnish with wedge of lemon and lime on a side plate. 
                        A dash of celery salt is a nice touch and New Yorkers traditionally add horseradish. Bloody Marys offer rich ground for improvisation both in garnish and ingredients. Have fun.</p>

                </h2>

                The national drink of Brazil, and party animals everywhere.

                Ingredients
                2 oz. Janeiro cachaça
                1½ barspoons of sugar or ¾ oz. simple syrup
                ½ lime, quartered

                Preparation: Place lime quarters in the bottom of mixing glass, add the sugar or syrup and muddle, extracting the juice and the oil in the skin from the lime quarters.
                Chill a rocks glass with cracked ice. Add cachaça (or white rum, for a Caipirissima, or Absolut vodka, for a Caipiroska) to the mixture in the glass, toss in the ice and shake well.
                Pour the entire contents of the mixing glass back into the chilled rocks glass and serve. Another method is to build the whole drink in the glass that will receive it, omitting the shaking.

                    6) Collins (Tom, John or Vodka) [1820-1830]
                </h2>

                The Collins goes back to London in the early nineteenth century, where places like the Garrick Club (for actors and other sporty types) and Limmer’s Hotel (patronized by dukes and bookies in equal proportion) began serving a Gin Punch that was stretched out with iced soda water. It takes its surname from John Collins, headwaiter at Limmer’s. Eventually, the John Collins changed from a drink made with Dutch genever or English Old Tom gin to one with American whiskey, while the gin version took on the name Tom Collins, due to both to the rise in popularity of Old Tom gin and a joke that was going around America in the 1870s about one Tom Collins who went around saying terrible things about people.

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Beefeater Gin, genever gin, bourbon or Absolut vodka
                ¾ oz. fresh lemon juice
                ¾ oz. simple syrup
                Club soda

                Preparation: Shake spirits, lemon juice and simple syrup with ice, strain into an iced Collins glass and fill with soda. Garnish with a cherry and an orange slice. For a Vodka Collins, replace the gin with Absolut vodka. For an old-style John Collins, use a Dutch genever or a good American bourbon whiskey.

                    7) Cosmopolitan [1980-1990]
                </h2>

                “The modern classic has conquered the world; I was given credit for inventing the Cosmo by New York magazine. I was not the inventor but I standardized the recipe and printed it on my cocktail menu at the Rainbow Room, where Madonna was spotted drinking one. That was all the rest of the world needed. The actual inventor is Cheryl Cook from South Beach in Miami, who recently surfaced to claim her invention.” —Dale DeGroff

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Absolut Citron vodka
                ¾ oz. Cointreau
                ¼ oz. fresh lime juice
                1 oz. Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail

                Preparation: Shake all ingredients with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with an orange peel.

                </h2>

                This Cuban drink derives its name from a town on the island’s southeastern coast. It’s the first classic straight-up cocktail to be invented outside the United States.

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. white rum
                ¾ oz. simple syrup
                ¾ oz. fresh lime juice

                Preparation: Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a small cocktail glass. Garnish with a lime wheel. Note: Purists will hold out for the original 1910s recipe:
                juice of half a lime, half a teaspoon superfine sugar, 2 oz. rum (assembled in that order, stirring the sugar into the lime juice before adding the rum).

                    9) Gimlet [1890-1900]
                </h2>

                In the late nineteenth century, the British Navy issued all sailors a ration of preserved lime juice to prevent scurvy. The officers, who did not receive the standard rum ration, mixed theirs with their preferred Plymouth gin. The ice came later.

                Ingredients
                2½ oz. Beefeater gin
                ½ oz. preserved lime juice (Rose’s or Angostura)

                Preparation: Shake ingredients well with ice and strain into a chilled martini glass or serve over ice in an old-fashioned glass. Garnish with lime wedge.

                    10) Gin Fizz [1870-1880]
                </h2>


                The fab drink of the 1870s, the Gin Fizz is simple, refreshing and endlessly adaptable (one of the most popular wrinkles calls for it to be made with an egg white, in which case it is a Silver Fizz;
                others involve adding six or eight raspberries or a lightly-muddled strawberry or two, when such things are in season).


                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Beefeater gin
                ¾ oz. fresh lemon juice
                ¾ oz. simple syrup (or 1 teaspoon superfine sugar)
                Club soda

                Preparation: Shake the gin, lemon juice and simple syrup and strain into a highball glass. Fill with club soda. No garnish.

                Note: The difference between the Fizz and a Collins is glass size, garnish and ice: a proper Fizz is served without ice in the glass, a Collins has it. The Collins goes in an extra-tall or “Collins” glass, with a cherry and orange slice garnish.

                    11) Hot Toddy [1750-1760]
                </h2>

                This simple drink is one of the oldest in the world’s drink vocabulary, dating back to Scotland in the middle of the 1700s. It’s also one of the best, whether made simply as below or fancied up with cider instead of the water and cloves, cinnamon sticks and other spices. (No video available)

                Ingredients
                2 oz. The Glenlivet single-malt Scotch whisky or Redbreast Irish whiskey
                1 well-filled barspoon demerara sugar or ¼ oz. honey
                1 strip of thin-cut lemon peel
                2-4 oz. boiling water


                Preparation: Rinse out a mug or hot whiskey glass with boiling water, to warm it. This is as essential a step with hot drinks as chilling the glass is with cold ones. Add the sugar or honey, the lemon peel and half an oz. or so boiling water. Stir until sugar or honey has dissolved. Add the whisky and another 1½ to 2½ ounces water, depending on how stiff a drink is required.

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Jameson Irish whiskey
                1 oz. simple or brown sugar syrup (equal parts of water and brown sugar, dissolved)
                4 oz. brewed coffee
                Lightly whipped unsweetened cream

                Preparation: Combine whiskey, coffee and syrup in an Irish coffee glass. Ladle a layer 1 inch (2.5 mm) thick of cream on top.

                </h2>

                The Manhattan story is told in Module III. Make it with Scotch, and you’ve got a Rob Roy,
                first introduced in 1895, probably at New York’s Fifth-Avenue Hotel. Make it with Irish whiskey, and it’s an Emerald (there are other names as well),
                which was a specialty of the Irish-staffed bar of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, just a few blocks up the street.


                Ingredients
                2 oz. Lot 40 Canadian Rye whisky or bourbon whiskey
                1 oz. Italian sweet vermouth
                2-3 dashes Angostura bitters

                Preparation: Pour all ingredients over ice in a mixing glass and stir as you would a Martini. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a cherry, although many discriminating drinkers prefer theirs with a twist. Note: If you prefer a dry Manhattan, use dry vermouth and garnish with a lemon peel. For a Perfect Manhattan, use ½ oz. each of dry and sweet vermouth and, again, deploy the peel.

                Note: For a Rob Roy, replace the bourbon or rye with a good blended Scotch whiskey, such as Chivas Regal. Many prefer orange bitters in this, with an orange twist at the end. For an Emerald, replace the American whiskey with a rich Irish one, such as John Powers or Redbreast. Many prefer orange bitters and an orange twist here, too.

                There aren’t a lot of essential tequila cocktails, but this one more than makes up for it. A child of the 1930s, the Margarita has grown up into one of the most popular cocktails of them all, and not without reason.


                Ingredients
                2 oz. Olmeca Altos Plata or Tequila Avión Silver
                ¾ oz. fresh lime juice
                ½ oz. agave nectar
                ( ½ oz. simple syrup is optional but necessary for many guests.)

                Coarse salt

                Preparation: Combine first three ingredients in a mixing glass with ice. Shake well and strain into a chilled salt- rimmed cocktail glass. Garnish with a lime wedge. Salting the rim: Frost the edge of the cocktail glass by rubbing a lime wedge on the outside rim of the glass, then dipping it into a saucer of coarse salt. Salt inside the glass is not a desirable outcome of this process. Note: Never use iodized salt on the rim of the glass.

                    16) Dry Martini [1890-1900]
                </h2>

                Nothing needs to be said for the Martini: it speaks for itself. The standard recipe from about 1895 to 1915.

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Beefeater London dry gin
                1½ oz. French dry vermouth
                1 or 2 dashes orange bitters

                Preparation: Stir all ingredients with ice to chill and twist orange peel or lemon peel over the top.


                Classic Extra Dry Martini (as it was made from 1950 on) [1950-1960]
                Ingredients
                3 oz. Beefeater London dry gin or Absolut vodka
                1/8 oz. dry French vermouth

                Preparation: Prepare a tall mixing glass with ice. Pour vermouth over ice and swirl to season, then strain off vermouth. Pour gin or vodka over seasoned ice and stir to chill. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish traditionally with a small pitted Spanish cocktail olive (no pimento).

                    17 ) Mint Julep [1790-1800]
                </h2>

                The great American classic, first recorded in 1793. Before the American Civil War, the favorite spirit to use in a Mint Julep was not whiskey, but rather old French cognac, often with a little Jamaican rum floated on top. After the Civil War, however, it became almost exclusively a whiskey drink. Either way, if it is made properly, there are few more delicious cocktails, particularly on a warm day.


                Ingredients
                2½ oz. straight bourbon or rye whiskey, or Martell VSOP cognac
                1 oz. simple syrup or 2 teaspoons superfine sugar
                2 to 4 sprigs of mint (use tender, young sprigs, since they last longer and look better)

                Preparation: Put the simple syrup or the sugar and ½ oz. water in the bottom of a highball glass. Add 5 or 6 mint leaves (from the bottom of the sprig) and press lightly with a muddler. Add half of the spirits and fill with crushed or finely cracked ice. Swirl with a barspoon until the outside of the glass frosts. Add more crushed ice and the remaining liquor. Stir again to frost the glass. Garnish with at least 1 sprig of mint, and preferably 3. Add a straw.

                    18) Mojito [1920-1930]
                </h2>

                This Cuban creation from the early years of the twentieth century has become the first breakout drink of the twenty-first.


                Ingredients
                1½ oz. white rum
                ¾ oz. fresh lime juice
                ¾ oz. simple syrup
                1 mint sprig and 4 mint leaves (use tender, young mint tops; peppermint is best because it doesn’t wilt and retains its shape).
                1 oz. soda


                Preparation: In a mixing glass muddle mint leaves with simple syrup. Add lime juice and rum and fill with ice. Shake vigorously and strain over fresh ice into a highball glass. Top with soda and garnish with a fresh mint sprig.

                -or-

                Muddle the mint leaves gently with the simple syrup and the lime juice in the bottom of a highball glass. Add the rum, stir, add ice and top with no more than two oz. of club soda. Garnish with a generous sprig of mint.

                    19) Negroni [1910-1920]
                </h2>

                Camillo Negroni (1868-1934) was a Florentine count who had spent time as a cowboy in the old West and a gambler in New York. When he returned to Florence, in the 1910s, he had the bartender at the Bar Casoni mix these up for him.

                Ingredients
                1 oz. Beefeater London dry gin
                1 oz. Campari
                1 oz. Italian sweet vermouth

                Preparation: Combine all ingredients in an iced old-fashioned glass and stir. Garnish with an orange peel or orange slice. The count liked his topped with a splash— say, an ounce or so—of soda. Others prefer theirs served straight up, in which case it should be stirred with ice, strained into a chilled cocktail glass and garnished with the peel, not the slice.

                    20) Old-Fashioned [1800-1810]
                </h2>
                <div>
                    By the 1860s, the original “Cock-Tail” of the beginning of the century had begun changing, and if that’s what you wanted, you had to order an “Old-Fashioned” cocktail.
                    A very simple and satisfying drink, the Old-Fashioned is the choice of many cocktail aficionados. Here are two versions, the original, nineteenth century one, and the rather more lush twentieth century version.


                    The Old-Fashioned Old-Fashioned
                    “My favorite version, and indeed my favorite cocktail of all time. I find it equally delicious if made with cognac or genever, both popular variations at the time when this drink was young.” David Wondrich


                    Ingredients
                    2 oz. Lot 40 Canadian Rye whisky or bourbon whiskey
                    2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
                    1 sugar cube or a well-filled barspoon of superfine sugar
                    Splash water or soda


                    Preparation: Muddle the sugar and the Angostura bitters in the splash of soda (about a barspoon—no more) until the sugar is dissolved, forming a syrup in the bottom of the glass.
                    Add the whiskey and the ice, and stir. Garnish with a fresh twist of orange peel.

                    Old Fashioned (Muddled) [1910-1920]
                    By 1915 or so, even the Old-Fashioned had begun changing; this is the version most people know today, and is Dale DeGroff’s preferred one.


                    Participants will not be asked to make this version during the final exam.


                    Ingredients
                    2 oz. Lot 40 Canadian Rye whisky
                    2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
                    1 sugar cube or a well-filled barspoon of superfine sugar
                    1 orange slice
                    1 maraschino cherry
                    Splash water or soda

                    Preparation: Muddle the sugar, bitters, one orange slice, one cherry, and a splash of soda carefully in the bottom of an old-fashioned glass. Remove the orange rind, add whisky/bourbon and ice and stir thoroughly. Garnish with an orange slice and a cherry.

                    21) Pisco Sour [1910-1920]
                </h2>

                Created by Victor Morris in Lima, Peru around 1915, the Pisco Sour has become the national drink of Peru—and of Chile,
                since both nations claim pisco as their own. The Pisco Sour is one of the drinks on the short list to step in as a global sensation when the Mojito falters.


                Ingredients
                2 oz. Pisco
                1 oz. fresh lime juice
                1 oz. simple syrup
                Several drops of Angostura bitters
                1 small egg white

                Preparation: Shake all ingredients very hard with ice and strain into a small cocktail glass. Garnish with several drops of Angostura bitters on top of the foam created by the egg whites.

                <h2>
                    22) Sazerac [1870-1880]
                </h2>

                New Orleans’ world-famous and beloved twist on the Old-Fashioned is accented with the bitters compounded
                by Antoine Amedee Peychaud in the mid-nineteenth century, who made a cognac cocktail by mixing them with Sazerac de Forge et Fils, the favorite cognac of the day.
                The drink took its modern form, with whiskey instead of cognac, in the 1880s, when Billy Wilkinson and Vincent Miret, the charismatic bartenders at the city’s Sazerac House, made their whiskey version famous.

                Ingredients
                2 oz. straight rye whiskey
                3-4 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
                Splash of Pernod 68 absinthe (or regular Pernod)
                ½ oz. simple syrup or 1 sugar cube and a tiny splash of water

                Preparation: Take two small old-fashioned glasses and chill one with ice while preparing the drink in the other by combining the rye, syrup or sugar, and the bitters and stirring with ice (preferably cracked) to chill. Empty the first glass of its chilling ice, splash a little absinthe into it, swirl it around to coat the inside, and pour it out. Strain the contents of the second glass into it and twist the lemon peel over the top. Note: If you can’t find the Peychaud’s bitters, you can still make this delicious cocktail with Angostura or other bitters; you just can’t call it a Sazerac. You can, however, call it an Improved Whiskey Cocktail. That formula, virtually identical to the Sazerac but with different bitters, dates back to the 1870s. For an improved cocktail, add a barspoon of Grand Marnier or maraschino liqueur.

                    23) Sidecar [1920-1930]
                </h2>

                The ultimate Art-Deco cocktail. A French creation of the early 1920s, the Sidecar was soon adopted by sophisticated barflies everywhere.


                Ingredients
                1½ oz. Martell VS or VSOP cognac
                ¾ oz. Cointreau
                ½ to ¾ oz. fresh lemon juice

                Preparation: Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a cocktail glass with sugared rim. Garnish with an orange peel.

                    24) Stinger [1890-1900]
                </h2>

                This classic New York nightcap—a rich man’s drink if ever there was one—goes back to the 1890s,
                an adult after-dinner mint that surprises with its refreshing taste. But remember there is only one drink that can follow a Stinger. . . another Stinger!

                Ingredients
                2¼ oz. Martell VS, VSOP or Cordon Bleu cognac
                ¾ oz. white crème de menthe

                Preparation: Shake both ingredients with ice and strain into an old fashioned glass filled with crushed ice or serve up in a chilled cocktail glass. Note: This is an exception to the rule that drinks with only liquors and liqueur should be stirred and also that proportions of the two ingredients can vary, many people preferring less crème de menthe and more cognac (David Wondrich recommends 2¼ ounces cognac to ¾ ounce crème de menthe).

                    25) Whiskey Sour [1850-1860]
                </h2>

                This simple concoction has been satisfying thirsts for a century and a half. It’s also an excellent base for experimentation.

                Ingredients
                1½ oz. bourbon or rye whiskey—or indeed any other kind of whiskey
                ¾ oz. simple syrup
                ¾ oz. fresh lemon juice

                Preparation: Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into an old-fashioned glass or a special sour glass. Garnish with a flag (an orange slice and a cherry). This drink is equally delicious when made with Irish whiskey. Some brave souls even like theirs with Scotch.
