    <h1>Tequila and Mezcal - What</h1>
    <p>
        Both Tequila and Mezcal are distilled spirits made from the agave plant. Both terms are tightly defined and
        controlled by the Mexican government. Most major countries honor and protect these regulations and definitions, with
        the sole exception of the United States—which is unfortunately the largest foreign market for these spirits.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tequila is sold in six styles, mostly based upon the aging of the spirit. Gold, or joven abacado, is a sweetened and
        caramel-tinged spirit; it’s the cheap stuff. It is usually made from a blend of sugars from agave and molasses from
        sugarcane, so it’s called mixto. By law, a mixto must derive no more than 49 percent of its sugars from anything
        other than agave, though as we have noted above, the U.S. government is unconcerned with enforcing these laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a Tequila is not a mixto, then it will be made from agave only. Some Tequila producers will label their product
        “100 percent Agave” and some will state “100% Blue Agave” or “100% Puro de Agave”. Blue Agave is one of the hundreds
        of types of agave growing around the world, and it thrives in tequila country. But if you’re seeking quality, “100%
        agave” ought to be good enough. Most, but not all, mixtos are forgettable, at best; many 100% agave tequilas are
        unforgettable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tequila that has aged no more than two months is called blanco or silver. Tequila that has aged for two to twelve
        months in any sized oak container is called reposado, or “rested.” Añejo means that the tequila has aged in small
        (600 liter) oak barrel for one to three years. Extra Añejo connotes that the tequila has stayed inside a small oak
        barrel for at least three years.
    </p>


    <h1>Tequila and Mezcal – Where</h1>
    <p>
        Tequila is produced in the five Mexican states of Jalisco (where the town of Tequila lies), Nayarit, Guanajuato,
        Michoacan and Tamaulipas. By law, a distillate made elsewhere in Mexico the same way and from the exact same
        materials cannot be called Tequila. Mezcal is primarily made in Oaxaca, but seven other states have also earned a
        Denomination of Origin: Guerrero, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Tamaulipas and Michoacan. Other
        agave spirits with official Mexican DOs include Bacanora from Sonora; Raicilla from the area around Puerto Vallarta,
        Jalisco; Tuxca from Tuxcacuesco, Jalisco; Comiteco from Comitan, Chiapas; and Sotol from Chihuahua.
    </p>

    <p>
        One hundred percent agave tequila is usually made from the blue agave, otherwise known as “tequilana weber,
        subvariety azul.” Mezcal can be made from espadin, cirial, cupreata, arroqueño, tobala, salmiana, tepestate,
        tobaziche and other agave varieties. But that’s not the only thing that separates it from tequila. Another key
        difference between tequila and mezcal is how the agave hearts are cooked.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Tequila, the halved agave hearts (called piñas) are steamed in autoclaves (these are stainless- steel pressure
        cookers used for the cheap stuff) or baked in ovens, or hornos. Baked is better. Piñas, so-called because they
        resemble large pineapples, can weigh 25 to 100 lb.
    </p>

    <p>
        With mezcal, the past is still present. The traditional way to cook agave hearts is to dig a pit and fill it with
        hot rocks as well as the fronds (pencas) of the agave plants and the agave hearts. These will roast (and smoke) for
        days, if not weeks. The resulting spirit is very smoky and earthy, compared to the tidier baked notes of tequila.
    </p>


    <h1>Tequila and Mezcal – How</h1>
    <p>
        It is a common misconception that the agave is a cactus. It is not, rather, it is but one of a family of succulents
        from the lily family, with more than 400 species. Agave’s botanical family name is agavacea, the Greek word for
        royalty, and at maturity (minimum of five to six years) develops a sap called aguamiel within its piña.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some books erroneously state that aguamiel is fermented into a kind of milky beer called pulque and then is
        distilled. WRONNNNNGGG. Pulque cannot be distilled, since it turns into something like gum in the pot still.
    </p>

    <p>
        To make tequila or mezcal, the agave hearts are cooked and shredded (or sometimes shredded then cooked), but they
        must be cooked before fermentation. The juice of the agave hearts is pressed out and then fermented; now the
        fermented juice can be distilled.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tequila and mezcal may be distilled either in continuous stills or pot stills. Most of the best are made only in pot
        stills or small hybrid stills. They come out of those stills at fairly low proof, compared to spirits such as vodka
        and even whiskey. As a result, tequila has a lot of flavors and aromas and seems very intense to most people.
        Nonetheless, well made tequila can finish with a gentler, tart and almost mild character, despite its assertive
        aromas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some mezcals are distilled in ancient, even primitive, clay pot stills. These medieval contraptions probably enhance
        the smoky flavor, but mezcals can be no less seductive than tequilas in their finish, even if the first flavors are
        wild and crazy.
    </p>


    <h1>Tequila and Mezcal – When</h1>
    <p>
        Although Tequila is a truly Mexican spirit, it is accurate to describe it as a Spanish invention. The heritage and
        history associated with this elixir dates back over a thousand years. Before the Spaniards brought the art of
        distillation to Mexico in the early 1500s, the Aztecs consumed a wine-like liquid called pulque, made from the
        fermented syrup extracted from the heart of agaves plants. Spaniards called it Vino de Mezcal. Though consumption of
        pulque was reserved almost exclusively for religious rites, the agave plant (aka, maguey) was utilized by Mexico’s
        native peoples for everything from food and drink to shoes, soap, building supplies, rope and even medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tequila’s fame rose north of the border more slowly. While a handful of border U.S. states—Arizona, Texas, New
        Mexico, California—joined in, the rest of the U.S. was ignorant of tequila’s charms until Prohibition. During that
        time, any spirit was good spirit, and tequila gained some notoriety, at least in gossip and print.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        It’s erroneous to assume that only the Margarita put tequila on the world consumer’s map, but it did a lot to
        popularize the strange Mexican spirit. Lots of people have claimed credit for the drink’s creation. In the late
        nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Daisy was a standard bar drink, with citrus juice, a syrup or liqueur
        sweetener (such as orange curaçao) and a spirit base. In the 1920s and 1930s, a drink called the Tequila Daisy was
        popular in the bars of Tijuana and elsewhere in Mexico.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we let Margarite Sames take all the credit for inventing the drink (that’s just one of many stories), we
        should note that the Spanish word for “daisy” is margarita. In any case, the Hollywood set of the 1930s partied
        heartily with Tequila Daisies or, if you prefer, Margaritas. Even today, the Margarita is the single most popular
        cocktail in the United States. It’s done a lot for tequila, even if some Margaritas seem to have very little tequila
        in them.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Despite U.S. intransigence in protecting the name, more than three quarters of tequila and mezcal exports are sold
        in this country. And tequila and mezcal dollar sales growth here outstrips any other category over the last decade,
        at least by percentage.
    </p>

    <p>
        It took a little longer for tequila to conquer the rest of the world, although it’s worth noting that the 1937 Café
        Royal Cocktail Book, from London, contains ten recipes for tequila drinks. But it really wasn’t until the 1970s that
        tequila began making inroads in European markets, where its growth was driven in no small part by the association
        that it had acquired with the counterculture and the rock-and-roll lifestyle.

    <h1>Tasting Tequila and Mezcal</h1>
    <p>
        As usual, the best way to find flavor and identify differences is to put several tequilas and mezcals next to each
        other. Mezcal should be readily identifiable by its characteristic smoky smells. Blanco, reposado, añejo and extra
        añejo will often be easy to spot by color alone, with añejo and extra añejo being deeper in color. So turn the
        lights down a bit and see if you can smell the differences.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most interesting distinctions to agave spirits is that the site where the agave is grown seems to be
        expressed in many Tequilas and Mezcals,. It’s especially noticeable in blancos and reposados, before the barrel has
        a chance to cover up more subtle differences. High elevation tequilas are often more citrusy in the mouth and nose
        (lemon, lime and grapefruit) and can have a smell that some people call “wet sidewalk” or “wet cement.”
    </p>

<h3>
    You’ll taste them to see if they are:
    </h3>
<ol>
    • Clean or dirty
    • Dry, salty, tart or slightly sweet
    • Smooth, spicy or aggressive
    • Gentle or powerful
    • Fruity, floral, vegetal, earthy and/or herbal
    • Rich or thin

    • Soft, sharp or burning
</ol>
    <p>
        If they are aged in oak, they can have all of the above flavors as well as spices, coconut, vanilla, chocolate, ash
        and other barrel/woody smells. Tequila can be very complex and powerful but it should be clean and dry and not
        bitter and not sweet.
